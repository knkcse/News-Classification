"Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s net profit rose 1.2% in the March quarter from the preceding one, its second straight quarter in the black, helped by strong user additions despite average revenue per user ( ARPU ) dropping due mainly to the sharp cut in its base offer to JioPhone users.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Mukesh Ambani-owned company, which has upended the market since its entry in September 2016 first with free voice and data and now much cheaper mobile Internet services, has posted a net profit of Rs 510 crore compared with Rs 504 crore in the October-December period. Revenue rose 3.6% sequentially to Rs 7,128 crore. Voice calls are still free.India’s fourth-largest telco by user base started reporting results from the three-month period ended September when it posted a loss of Rs 271 crore. This compares with the first net loss for Bharti Airtel’s India operations in nearly 15 years in the January-March period.Idea is expected to widen its fourth-quarter net loss when it reports on April 28. For the full year, Jio posted a net profit of Rs 723 crore on revenue of Rs 20,154 crore.Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (ebitda) amounted to Rs 6,734 crore while the ebitda margin was 33.4%. “The strong financial results of Jio in a competitive market environment demonstrates the robustness of the Jio business model and ability to offer the most value to our customers and partners,” said Mukesh Ambani , chairman, Reliance Industries, Jio’s parent. “Jio has demonstrated that it can scale and sustain its strong financial performance.”The new telecom entrant’s average revenue per user (ARPU)—a key performance parameter—fell to Rs 137.1 from Rs 154 in the third quarter. Ebitda for the quarter was Rs 2,694, up 2.5% sequentially.Jio’s performance came a few days after market leader Bharti Airtel reported a Rs 652-crore net loss for its India business, before exceptional items, hurt by cuts in international termination rates interconnection usage charges, besides the ongoing price war. Revenue fell 13% with ARPU at Rs 116, its lowest ever.Anshuman Thakur, Jio’s head of strategy and planning, told reporters that the company’s accounting was in line with the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind-AS).Some analysts had said the company had been able to declare a profit in the third quarter by keeping costs low thanks to the unit-of-production method of accounting.They had also pointed out that Jio had accounted for six months of revenue in the three months to December.“Revenues are recognised as and when services are provided,” Thakur said. “The tariff plan clearly mentions that the revenues would be recognised in the last month of the first recharge cycle, and now all our current revenues are for the quarter, so when they recharge we render the service and we recognise the revenue.”The accounting method may colour perceptions, said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president, markets and corporate affairs, IIFL.“But still, with ebitda positive and ARPU at Rs 137, Jio is clearly an outperformer,” he said. “Against Rs 116, which is the lowest I have seenin so many quarters, from the country's largest operator Bharti, they've got an upside of 17-18%.” He added that the just-ended quarter had been the worst as far as pricing goes, but Jio still enjoys a lead on ARPU, despite this falling on quarter.“ARPU dip was the result of the price action that happened earlier on in the quarter. It was around Rs 50 reduction in tariff plans that has been impact on ARPU, but we have been more than able to make up on it through the subscriber goal,” said Thakur.He was referring to the cut in its base offer to JioPhone users to Rs 49 from Rs 90, to attract more users to its network.The quarterly ebitda margin though contracted to 37.8% compared with 38.2% in the preceding one, on higher costs and muted revenue growth. Airtel, in comparison, had a margin of 28.4% for its India mobile services business.Network operating expenses were around Rs 1,812 crore, compared with nearly Rs 1,737 crore in the third quarter, while depreciation and amortisation costs rose to Rs 1,199 crore from Rs 1,193 crore. Total expenses rose to Rs 6,345 crore from Rs 6,109 crore.Jio, which added a net 26.5 million subscribers to end March with 186.6 million users on its network, still has more calls terminating on its rivals’ network that have more users, and is thus a net payer of interconnection usage charges (IUC), which were reduced by the telecom regulator by 57% from October 1. In the latest quarter, Jio paid nearly Rs 1,065.9 crore as IUC, compared with Rs 1,082 crore in the preceding one. The company had paid nearly Rs 2,140 crore in the July-September quarter.Total wireless data traffic in the quarter was 5.06 billion GB, up 14% on quarter and much higher than its more established rivals such as Bharti Airtel, which recorded around 1.5 billion GB.Average data consumption per user per month was 9.7 GB while average voice traffic was 716 minutes per user per month.Airtel, in comparison, recorded 670 minutes per user, while data usage per subscriber was 6.6 GB. Jio saw 0.25% of users moving to another network, compared with Airtel’s 2.8%.Debt stood at Rs 57,000 crore, on an equity base of over Rs 1.02 lakh crore.The company recorded capex of about Rs 14,000 crore in the March quarter, compared with Rs 7,000 crore in the third quarter.“This spurt has been because we are completing our wireless network and deliveries happened in this quarter.

Since the liberalisation of the economy in the early 90s, the switch to the Goods and Service Tax regime has probably been the biggest economic reform in India. The new tax regime replaced hundreds of overlapping and cascading taxes at the central and state level into one national tax system. The tax reform was expected to bring in an additional 25% of the businesses under the tax net and provide a 4.2% boost to the countrys GDP. However, 100 days since its implementation, these estimations are Read more..",business,https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/tag/industry

Mumbai: On a consolidated basis, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) reported a 39% year-on-year increase in revenue to Rs1.29 trillion and a 17% growth in net profit to Rs9,435 crore.

The performance of its various business segments was a mixed bag. The refining business disappointed with a gross refining margin of $11 a barrel, lower than Street estimates. But the petrochemicals business did well, with the segment’s profit increasing 87% year-on-year. The organized retail business sprang a surprise with segment profit increasing by a whopping 291% to Rs951 crore.

But investors who track the fortunes of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will be disappointed. Firstly, Jio’s revenue growth slowed to 3.6% last quarter, much lower than the 11.9% sequential growth it had reported in the December quarter. This should worry telcos because the longer Jio takes to reach its revenue share targets, the longer the struggles of the sector may continue. Cut-throat pricing has dragged other telcos to losses, besides resulting in huge debt.

The other big worry is that Jio reported capital expenditure of Rs14,000 crore for the March quarter, far higher than the Rs7,000 crore it had reported in the preceding two quarters. Companies such as Idea Cellular Ltd have fallen behind in their 4G coverage because of balance sheet constraints, and Jio’s aggression on the capex front means it will remain far ahead of competition in terms of coverage. To be sure, capex tends to be lumpy. Even so, Jio has spent Rs28,000 crore on capex in the past three quarters, compared with revenues of Rs20,154 crore. After accounting for operating and interest expenses of another Rs15,000 crore, it burnt over Rs23,000 crore in just the past three quarters. The company’s capex is expected to remain high, since it plans to increase the number of base stations substantially from current levels. The acquisition of Reliance Communications Ltd’s assets will only add to the tally.

The tariff cuts announced by Jio in January hit its own revenues as well. Still, due to strong subscriber additions and the manner in which the company accounts for its Prime membership, some analysts had anticipated growth to remain high. Analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities, for instance, had estimated revenue growth of 10% for Jio. The firm has been accounting for revenues from sales of its Prime membership, assuming its benefits will end in March 2018. As such, for memberships sold in the March quarter, the entire Rs99 for the membership was expected to be accounted for. The fact that revenue growth was under 4% despite this boost and a 17% jump in subscriber base is a dampener. The all-important question is how Jio responds to the deceleration in its growth rates.",business,https://www.livemint.com/Money/WbBJ0WAgIjN73rAd9rUqhP/Why-Reliance-Jios-March-quarter-result-is-bad-news-for-telc.html
"MUMBAI: Reliance Industries clocked record profits of Rs 9,435 crore in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, up 17 per cent, on higher margins from its petrochemicals , retail and digital services businesses. This indicates that RIL makes around Rs 105 crore a day. Higher earnings from petrochemicals, retail and digital services businesses helped the company offset the lower contribution from the refining and oil & gas ventures. RIL's consolidated profit was Rs 8,046 crore a year earlier.The digital services business, run under the Jio brand, posted a net profit of Rs 510 crore in Q4FY18. This is the second time in a row the telecom unit has declared a profit. RIL had launched the telecom services in September 2016. Jio is six times more profitable than Bharti Airtel, whose consolidated profit in Q4FY18 was Rs 83 crore. The digital services business posted an operating profit of Rs 1,495 crore compared to an operational loss of Rs 32 crore. Revenues of the business stood at Rs 8,421 crore in Q4FY18, helped by a 16 per cent rise in subscribers.RIL's consolidated revenues climbed 39 per cent to Rs 1.29 lakh crore on strong volumes from its petrochemicals business due to newly commissioned projects and higher product prices, and a134 per cent surge in its retail business. For the full financial year 2017-18, RIL, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani , recorded a profit of Rs 36,075 crore, an increase of 21 per cent while revenues were up by 31 per cent to Rs 4.3 lakh crore. Operating profit expanded nearly 34 per cent to Rs 74,184 crore ($11.4 billion).“FY 2017-18 was a landmark year for Reliance where we established several records on both operating and financial parameters.

This offset the marginal fall in operating profit in the refining segment to ₹6,165 crore due to dip in crude volumes refined.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping began their last round of one-on-one talks in Wuhan on Saturday as they are set to wind up the two-day informal summit aimed at forging consensus to improve the bilateral relations and address the contentious issues bedevilling ties.

Saturday's talks included a walk around the famous East Lake in Wuhan and an hour-long boat ride.

They would conclude their talks with one-on-one lunch hosted by Mr. Xi in honour of Mr. Modi.

The Prime Minister is due to leave for home after that.

'Held extensive, fruitful talks'

Mr. Modi on Saturday said he held “extensive and fruitful” talks with Mr. Xi during their first round of two-day informal summit in Wuhan.

“I am very pleased to meet with President Xi Jinping in Wuhan. We conducted extensive and fruitful talks and exchanged opinions on strengthening India-China relations and other international issues,” Mr. Modi said in a post on the popular Chinese social media site Weibo, where he has 1,83,112 followers.

“Thank you, President Xi Jinping, for the wonderful gesture of personally accompanying me in the Hubei Provincial Museum. The Museum is home to great facets of Chinese history and culture,” he said.

Mr. Modi and Mr. Xi are due to conclude their unprecedented informal summit on April 28, seen as an effort by India and China to rebuild trust and improve ties that were hit by the 73-day-long Doklam standoff last year.

Mr. Modi is spending only about 24 hours in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, just months after a dispute between the two countries over a stretch of their high-altitude Himalayan border.

More an informal meeting

Billed by both sides as an informal meeting rather than a summit, with none of the pomp and ceremony of a state visit such as 21-gun salutes, the two men held talks on Friday that lasted far longer than expected.

Mr. Modi will take a walk around a guesthouse with Mr. Xi on Saturday, then an hour-long boat trip on a lake followed by lunch, before the meeting ends, according to the External Affairs Ministry.

Chinese state media has praised the tone of the trip so far.

The overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in a front page commentary on Saturday “two great countries ought to have great cooperation”, and showed a large picture of the two leaders shaking hands.

“There is reason to believe that this Wuhan meeting will increase mutual trust, manage and control disputes, deepen cooperation and lead to a new phase in China-India relations,” it said.

“It is quite clear that strategic agreement between the two countries far exceeds the specific differences, and the need for cooperation far exceeds local friction,” it said.",business,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/held-extensive-fruitful-talks-with-xi-says-modi-on-chinese-social-media-weibo/article23706140.ece

IN A rare acknowledgement of India’s role in global affairs, Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday said the influence of India and China was increasing steadily in the region and the world, and that there was “vast space” and a “bright future” for bilateral cooperation.

In remarks after two hours of conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the first day of their “informal summit” in Wuhan, Xi expressed hope that they will reach a “common, new and important understanding that will help take our relationship to the next level”.

Officials from both sides indicated that they were working on a new framework, described as a “modus vivendi” or arrangement to bridge the strategic trust deficit.

While a joint document is not being ruled out, Foreign Secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale is likely to articulate the government’s takeaways after the summit Saturday.

As reported by The Indian Express, the two sides are working on a framework to mend strained ties over the recent years, especially during the Doklam crisis. If finalised, the framework would outline the “principles” of engagement between the two without dwelling on specific issues.

Speaking before the start of delegation-level talks, Xi said, “Our two countries’ influence in the world, and in our region, is steadily on the rise. Looking ahead, we see vast space and a bright future for China-India cooperation.”

Modi outlined the five pillars or elements of India-China cooperation — “thought, communication, cooperation, dream and commitment” — and how these can become the strength of world peace, stability and prosperity.

The Prime Minister underlined that Xi’s vision of a “New Era” and his own vision of “New India” are similar concepts and will benefit the world. Modi also invited Xi to India for an informal summit next year, and the Chinese leader expressed hope that they will be able to meet in similar formats.

The two spoke to each other, across the table and accompanied by senior officials from both sides, with a framed photograph of snow-capped mountains in the backdrop.

“In the past three years and more, you and I have exchanged visits, have met each other a number of times in multilateral occasions. We have jointly guided the growth of India, China relations and have seen that it has maintained good momentum,” Xi said.

Without mentioning the trust deficit, the Chinese President said, “Our two countries have established a closer developmental partnership, our exchanges and cooperation in various fields have made positive progress… China and India have a combined population of over 2.6 billion, with an enormous potential for technology development and domestic market.”

He said the “international situation is at a crucial period of adjustment”, alluding to global events surrounding the summit — from the US-China trade war to peace between the two Koreas.

“China and India are both important countries for global growth. Looking ahead, our two countries need to maintain strong and determined focus on national development, deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, work together for our respective national revitalisation and partner with each other to build an Asia in the 21st century that enjoys stability, development and prosperity,” Xi said.

“We also need to make positive contributions for global peace and development… I believe, in the future we will meet in format like this from time to time. I look forward to having in-depth communication with your excellency,” he said.

Xi called for continuous strengthening of friendly relations between the two countries so that “their friendship will continue to flow forward like the Yangtze and Ganges” rivers, Xinhua quoted him as saying. It also said that the informal meeting will open a “new chapter” in bilateral ties.

Earlier, Modi met Xi at the Hubei provincial museum and took a tour before a one-on-one meeting. He told Xi that the “people of India feel really proud that I am the first Prime Minister of India for whom you have come out of the capital twice to receive me”.

Modi said, “You have rightly said that we, as responsible leaders, represent 40 per cent of the world’s population, and this is not just a meeting of two leaders, but I see it from the perspective of a historic and cultural legacy… world is witness to this, and there has been in-depth study on this… that in the last 2,000 years of history, India and China have given momentum or pace to world economy and our two countries contributed 50 per cent of the world economy… rest of the world was restricted to the remaining 50 per cent… so much impact and influence for 1600 years, it’s a big thing… and it had an impact on social, religious, economic, cultural, scientific, in every sector, it had a positive impact.”

He said, “I think the closeness between us, the trust that we have on each other, the time we are spending, these will convert into people-to-people contact… that will be our biggest strength, and that will be the strength for the world’s bright future.”

He then spelt out strength: “S stands for spirituality, T stands for tradition, trade and technology, R is relationship, E is entertainment, our movies, dances, culture, museum, A is for Art, N is for nature, and H is for health” — essentially covering the major spheres of cooperation. Ministry of External Affairs’ official spokesperson Raveesh Kumar later said that G stands for “Games” — meaning sports.

After these statements, Modi and Xi went for a delegation-level talks accompanied by top officials from both sides, including Gokhale and NSA Ajit Doval. Politburo member Yang Jiechi, Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Vice Foreign minister Kong Xuanyou were present on the Chinese side. The two sides then had dinner at the East Lake guest house.

They will be meeting again Saturday, where they will have more one-on-one conversations, including a walk on the lakeside and a boat ride, followed by lunch between the two leaders.

"New Delhi: Goods and services tax (GST) collections averaged just under Rs 90,000 crore a month in the first eight months after the rollout of the levy, adding up to Rs 7.19 lakh crore in the year ended March amid a steady improvement in compliance, the government said.Analysts said collections were below estimates but the phased introduction of a key component will boost revenue from the indirect tax.“The average monthly collection under GST for FY 2017-18 was around Rs 90,000 crore, implying a deficit of approximately 24% in reference to the estimations for 2018-19,” said Abhishek Jain, tax partner, EY India.“While the deficit is apparently perturbing, it is expected to be reduced with e-way bills in place and possible introduction of other anti-evasion measures such as TDS/TCS (tax deducted at source/tax collected at source), credit matching, etc.” Domestic collections are for the July 2017-February 2018 period while those on imports are for nine months including March 2018.“While the tax on domestic supplies in a month is collected through the process of returns and gets collected in the next month, IGST (integrated GST) and cess on imports gets collected in the same month,” the finance ministry said in a statement.GST on domestic supplies has been collected for eight months from August 2017 to March 2018, while IGST and the cess on imports have been collected for nine months, from July 2017 to March 2018.“For these eight months, the average monthly collection has been Rs 89,885 crore,” the ministry said. Including the receipts in July, the total collections amount to Rs 7.41 lakh crore. Rolled out on July 1 last year, GST is one of the government’s biggest economic reforms and is aimed at creating a common market by removing multiple levies, thereby eventually feeding into the economic revival that’s currently underway.'Collections have been below par since not everyone registered for GST has been filing returns, although compliance levels have increased gradually.The government suggested that collections may be stabilising as the indirect tax regime gains wider acceptance after fluctuations over the past few months.GST receipts rose in December 2017 to Rs 86,703 crore, reversing a decline in the preceding two months — Rs 80,808 crore in November, Rs 83,000 crore in October, from over Rs 92,000 crore in September.It slipped to Rs 86,318 crore in January and to Rs 85,174 crore in February.

"NEW DELHI: Buoyed by year-end sales, which helped the government mop up close to Rs 1 lakh crore in Goods and Services Tax GST ) during March, collections during the first year of rollout were estimated at Rs 7.4 lakh crore.Although the government did not disclose the March collection numbers, sources said that the overall number was the highest-ever monthly receipt. In a statement, the finance ministry said that collections between August 2017 and March 2018 were estimated at Rs 7.2 lakh crore, including Rs 1.2 lakh crore of central GST, Rs 1.7 lakh crore of state GST, Rs 3.6 lakh crore of integrated GST (which included Rs 1.7 lakh crore from imports). The rest came through compensation cess levied on luxury and sin goods such as high-end vehicles, tobacco and soft drinks.Including the collections in July, the overall figure added up to Rs 7.4 lakh crore. This translated into monthly collections of a shade under Rs 90,000 crore amid signs that the Centre and states will help realise more funds in the coming months as the new regime was showing signs of settling down and the government’s moves to check leakage of funds was picking pace.Abhishek Jain, partner at EY India , said that the monthly collection data pointed to a deficit of around 24% of the estimates for financial year 2018-19. “While the deficit is apparently perturbing, it is expected to be reduced with e-way bills being in place and possible introduction of other antievasion measures like TDS/ TCS , credit matching etc,” he added.Although compliance was seen to be a problem, with the blame being put on the returns, the proportion of registered taxpayers filing returns too seems to have stabilised.While the Centre did have to compensate some of the states for revenue loss after the new regime kicked in from July, it was left with over Rs 20,000 crore surplus in the fund where the compensation cess levied on sin and luxury goods such as tobacco and high-end vehicle flowed in. Against a mop-up of Rs 62,000 crore through the cess, compensation paid till February was estimated at a little over Rs 41,000 crore.The March numbers have already raised demands for rationalisation of rates. “Collection for March is likely to exceed Rs 1 lakh crore. Also, after introduction of e-way bill from April 1, one could expect the revenue buoyancy to continue. With this, government might want to consider further rate rationalization, particularly reducing the 28% items to 18%,” said Pratik Jain, partner and leader for indirect tax practice at consulting firm PwC India",business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-mops-up-rs-7-4-lakh-crore-in-gst-during-july-2017-mar-2018/articleshow/63947143.cms

Revenue from the Goods and Services Tax touched ₹7.19 lakh crore between August 2017 and March 2018, according to official data, which pegs average monthly revenue at ₹89,885 crore for the period.

“This includes ₹1.19 lakh crore of CGST, ₹1.72 lakh crore of SGST, ₹3.66 lakh crore of IGST (including ₹1.73 lakh crore on imports) and ₹62,021 crore of cess (including ₹5,702 crore on imports),” the government said in a release on Friday. “For this eight months, the average monthly collection has been ₹89,885 crore.”

The government explained that while the tax on domestic supplies in a month is collected through the returns process and gets collected in the subsequent month, IGST and cess on imports get collected in the same month. For the current year, “GST on domestic supplies has been collected only in eight months from August 2017 to March 2018, IGST and cess on imports have been collected for nine months, from July 2017 to March 2018,” the release added. “Including the collection of July 2017, total GST collection in the financial year 2017-18 stands provisionally at ₹7.41 lakh crore.”

“The collection is below target as rate cuts were announced in the recent past and various refunds in case of export and other cases have also been cleared,” Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at Khaitan & Co, said in a note. “It is hoped that the compliance level will improve further and all assessees registered will start paying taxes, thereby leading to improved GST collections in the new financial year.”

“The average monthly collection under GST for FY18 was around ₹90,000 crore, [implying] a deficit of approximately 24% in reference to the estimations for this financial year, i.e., for FY 2018-19,” Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY India wrote in a note. While the deficit was “apparently perturbing”, it was “expected to be reduced with e-way bills being in place and possible introduction of other anti-evasion measures like TDS/TCS, credit matching, etc,” he said.

Compliance levels have remained poor across the period, as shown by the percentage of registered taxpayers who have filed their returns by the due dates of the respective months. While this proportion was 57.7% for July 2017, it rose only to 62.6% by March 2018.

‘Further rate cuts’

“With the GSTN [GST Network] system working smoothly and no hindrances for generating e-way bills, the compliance level should increase further,” Parag Mehta, partner at NA Shah Associates, said. “With many States also introducing the intra-State generation of e-way bills for movement of goods, evasion is bound to reduce with a rise in revenue,” he said.

Official data showed that while many taxpayers miss their filing deadlines, they do eventually get down to filing their returns. For example, the data showed 96% of those who had to file returns for July 2017, had done so by March 2018.

Some tax analysts point at the tax revenue buoyancy and said the GST Council can consider further rationalisations in the GST tax rates.

“Collection for March is likely to exceed ₹1 lakh crore,” Pratik Jain, partner and leader, Indirect Tax, t PwC India, said. “After the introduction of e-way bills..., one could expect revenue buoyancy to continue. [The Centre] might want to consider further rate rationisation, particularly reducing the 28% items to 18%.”",business,http://www.thehindu.com/business/gst-clocks-719-cr-for-8-months/article23701648.ece
"The aviation industry may have been surprised by the exit of Aditya Ghosh, who late Friday announced he was stepping down as IndiGo's President.

But many now point at the appointment of Wolfgang Prock-Schauer as Chief Operating Officer in January as the first sign of more leadership churn at the top of India's largest airline by market share.

An industry veteran of nearly 40 years, Prock-Schauer came with a mix of India and overseas experience with stints in Air Berlin, Jet Airways, Austrian Airlines and GoAir.

His experience was said to be crucial for IndiGo, which is preparing to launch long haul flights.

As of now the airline flies to West Asia and South-East Asia.

Now Rahul Bhatia, IndiGo's promoter, has added one more expat in the senior leadership.

Along with Ghosh's exit, Bhatia — who takes over as the interim CEO — also announced the appointment of Greg Taylor as Senior Advisor.

Taylor, who was IndiGo's Executive Vice President of Revenue Management & Network Planning during 2016-17, will later take over as President & CEO of the airline later this year.

As Bhatia mentioned in the letter to IndiGo employees - ""Greg has more than 40 years of enormous and varied experience in large, World Class Airlines. This experience and his ability to understand the complexities of the airline industry will be invaluable to our future plans.""

Sources told Moneycontrol that one more big addition is set to happen in IndiGo's leadership.

Willy Boulter, who was vice-president, commercial strategy at Etihad Airways and a senior executive at IATA - the trade association of world airlines, may join IndiGo as Chief Strategy Officer.

Till February this year, Boulter was Chief Commercial Officer of TAAG Angola Airlines. While at Etihad, he was Chief Commercial Officer for Jet Airways, subsequent to the investment by the Gulf airline in its Indian peer.

Interestingly, his Linkedin profile shows that since February, he is ""in transition.""

All the three — Prock-Schauer, Taylor and Boulter — come with considerable international exposure coupled with understanding of the Indian aviation market.

However, not everyone is convinced by Bhatia's move to induct such heavyweight expat executives at the top.

""It's debatable if we need expats to run the business. And bringing in different people in different areas may not be a cohesive team,"" a senior executive from the industry told Moneycontrol.

""But many hands-on owner managers seem to think so. (Naresh) Goyal also does the same thing,"" the executive added.

The Jet Airways Chairman is known for his preference for expats. The airline's present Group Executive Officer is Capt Hameed Ali, a Bahraini national.

Over the years, many expats like Nikos Kardassis, a Greek American, Victoriano Dungca, who was a veteran in Philippine Airlines, and Ali Ghandour, who founded Royal Jordanian, have been part of the senior management in Jet Airways.

Bhatia also depended on an expat - Bruce Ashby - to set up IndiGo. Ashby was the airline's founding President and CEO.

IndiGo is presently standing at a crucial juncture. It now operates 1,000 flights a day, will induct record number of aircraft into its fleet (including 50 ATRs) and will expand its wings nationally and internationally.

It's unclear what exactly led to Ghosh's exit. Bhatia's letter to the employees says that Ghosh is looking to start a business venture.

But surely, it was getting top heavy at IndiGo.",business,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/aditya-ghoshs-exit-coincides-with-senior-expat-execs-entry-into-indigo-2559467.html

"Ghosh in a statement said that it was time for him to step off the treadmill and sometime in the near future embark on his next adventure.

Country’s largest airline IndiGo in a stock exchange filing on Friday said that its has accepted the resignation of its President and whole time Director, Aditya Ghosh and its Director, Rahul Bhatia will be the interim Chief Executive Officer of the airline. Bhatia who is also the director of the company will continue to remain so but the company will be appointing a CEO soon. The company also announced the appointment of Gregory Taylor as Senior Advisor to the company reporting directly to Rahul. He also is an aviation veteran and has held various important positions at airlines like with United Airlines and US Airways.

Ghosh, who is a CA by profession has been IndiGo’s President since 2008 and has been instrumental in the steady and solid rise of IndiGo from the time it launched operations in August 2006 with a single aircraft to county’s largest airline with nearly 40 % market share and a 161 aircraft fleet. He also saw the airline being listed at the stock exchanges and with an eight fold increase in the top line over the past decade with a market cap of Rs 55,000 crore.Sources within the airline say that the move is not a sudden one and there have been signs that Ghosh might move out of the airline. Ghosh has not been attending the regular head of department meets at the airline for over a month now and IndiGo has been staffing expats, Taylor being one of them, for all important functions of the airline like the revenue management and others.

“In the coming months , the Board will consider the appointment of Greg as President and CEO of the company, subject to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals and paperwork,” IndiGo said. Sources say the airline, of late, was practically run by Rakesh Gangwal, an aviation veteran who has worked carrier like United Airlines, and later on went on to set up IndiGo with his long time friend Rahul Bhatia who currently will helm the function of the CEO of the airline in the interim.

Aditya Ghosh is probably the sharpest of the minds in the country or in the airline business who knows aircraft pricing specifically the Airbus pricing like the back of his hand and he has done a commendable job in planning the fleet expansion at the airline and crafting leases and maintenance contracts for IndiGo that are probably the best in business and very farsighted for an Indian airline.“We thank Aditya for all his hard work and contributions and for the successes that the company has enjoyed,” Bhatia said in the release.

Ghosh in a statement said that it was time for him to step off the treadmill and sometime in the near future embark on his next adventure.",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/aditya-ghosh-resigns-as-indigo-president/1148515/
"During those turbulent days when faced public ire for manhandling a passenger on the tarmac, changed his WhatsApp profile picture to ‘Forever 6E’. 6E is the code which cheekily uses as ‘’sexy’’ for branding purpose. To show his loyalty, he even sports wrist bands with the company logo. Ghosh, with no prior aviation background or MBA degree unlike most top executives of India Inc, managed not only to become the CEO of an airline but even piloted it to the top with almost half of the market.

After graduating from law college, Ghosh had joined J Sagar Associates. Jyoti Sagar, founder of the legal firm, gave him the responsibility to handle important clients including Rahul Bhatia’s InterGlobe Enterprise, which had interests in the travel and hospitality sector. It was 2004 and Bhatia was preparing to launch his own airline, Impressed with his work, Bhatia roped in Ghosh as General Counsel. It was a significant role as the company was finalising a mega aircraft order, the biggest in India’s aviation history. Ghosh handled all complex legal aspects with manufacturer and lessors.

He must have handled it well because when the first CEO retired, Ghosh was instantly made the CEO. A person who was part of the launch team says Bhatia liked Ghosh’s diligence and will to learn. Subsequently, he was made the president.

Ghosh was swift to respond to the role. It was the time of sky rocketing oil prices. He kept things at running with a few elementary guidelines — low cost, on time, efficiency. “I would say Ghosh successfully put on auto pilot. What implemented at IndiGo, till today it is operated on that concept,” an airline executive said.

As they say luck favours the brave, Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher shut shop in 2012 after acquiring Air Deccan. It was immediately followed by near-bankruptcy at SpiceJet, leaving a large vacuum in the market. With a robust order book which meant was adding at least one aircraft every month, the airline successfully capitalised on it. By July 2012, six years after it started operations, became the market leader with 27 per cent share surpassing Jet group’s 26 per cent. The gap has been widening since then.

In an interview earlier, Ghosh said that learning the tricks of business has been tough and he has constantly worked to increase his knowledge from global peers. At his office, Ghosh’s bookshelf still shows signs of the airline outsider that he once was. Aviation case studies such as Nuts! Southwest Airlines’ Crazy Recipe for Business and Personal Success and Ruinair jostle for space with titles such as Richard Branson’s Business Stripped Bare and Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell.

By 2015, when did public listing, Ghosh had become the face of the airline. People say what clicked for Ghosh was his ability to connect with people from all spheres of the company. In his communication with employees, Ghosh made it a point to add a line- “You people make me look so good and successful.” In fact, in his note to the employees announcing his exit on Friday, he said quite the same. “You ask any pilot and he would tell you how approachable Ghosh was, the CEO was just one WhatsApp message away, can’t ask for more,” says a pilot.

But the last few months have been turbulent for both Ghosh and From a public relations crisis to engine woes. As Ghosh prepares for his next inning, is gearing up to be a 200 aircraft company and is eyeing long haul operations, now under a new leadership.

The changes might show results, but employees could still miss ‘Captain Ghosh’.",business,http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/changes-might-show-results-but-indigo-may-still-miss-captain-ghosh-118042800067_1.html
"The stock of Axis Bank gained 8.97%, on Friday

The stock of Axis Bank gained 8.97%, on Friday, despite reporting its first-ever quarterly loss as investors were enthused by outgoing CEO Shikha Sharma’s declaration that the recognition of bad loans in this cycle is “nearly complete.”

The stock ended the session at Rs 538.90 on the BSE, and was the best performing Sensex stock on Friday.

Axis Bank on Thursday reported a net loss of Rs 2,189 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 after more than doubling provisions, year-on-year, to Rs 7,180 crore. This is Axis Bank’s first quarterly loss since it listed in 1998.

Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to investors said that Axis Bank took an important step to recognise NPLs on a majority of the balance of stress highlighted to investors in the past few years. “As we speak today, we have seen the highest level of slippages. A negative outlook on the book today is not warranted from here. The slippages would decline steeply, in our view, in FY2019-20,” the note said.

The brokerage kept its target price for Axis Bank’s stock Rs 600. “In our view, there is much greater comfort in assigning relatively higher multiples on cleaner book with the potential to return to mid-teen RoEs in the medium term.

Fundamental strengths such as high CASA ratio, distribution network and high and growing share of retail loans are key positives. The principal risk to RoE improvement is a prolonged NPL resolution leading to higher-than-expected credit costs,” the note added.

Edelweiss in its note said though retail continues to strengthen, earnings visibility remains weak. “FY18 performance has rattled investors’ confidence. This, along with uncertainty at top management level will cap valuations in near to medium term,” the note said.

Axis Bank’s stock has declined 4.2% since the beginning of 2018. However, analysts are still bullish on the stock. Out of 52 analysts who track the stock on Bloomberg, 28 have a ‘buy’ rating, 9 have a ‘sell’ rating and 15 have a ‘hold.’",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/axis-bank-up-9-after-first-ever-loss-analysts-welcome-a-clean-book/1148455/

Axis Bank on Thursday reported a net loss of Rs 2,189 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 after more than doubling provisions, year-on-year, to Rs 7,180 crore. This is Axis Bank’s first quarterly loss since it listed in 1998.

Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to investors said that Axis Bank took an important step to recognise NPLs on a majority of the balance of stress highlighted to investors in the past few years. “As we speak today, we have seen the highest level of slippages. A negative outlook on the book today is not warranted from here. The slippages would decline steeply, in our view, in FY2019-20,” the note said.

The brokerage kept its target price for Axis Bank’s stock Rs 600. “In our view, there is much greater comfort in assigning relatively higher multiples on cleaner book with the potential to return to mid-teen RoEs in the medium term.

Fundamental strengths such as high CASA ratio, distribution network and high and growing share of retail loans are key positives. The principal risk to RoE improvement is a prolonged NPL resolution leading to higher-than-expected credit costs,” the note added.

Edelweiss in its note said though retail continues to strengthen, earnings visibility remains weak. “FY18 performance has rattled investors’ confidence. This, along with uncertainty at top management level will cap valuations in near to medium term,” the note said.

Axis Bank’s stock has declined 4.2% since the beginning of 2018. However, analysts are still bullish on the stock. Out of 52 analysts who track the stock on Bloomberg, 28 have a ‘buy’ rating, 9 have a ‘sell’ rating and 15 have a ‘hold.’",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/market/axis-bank-up-9-after-first-ever-loss-analysts-welcome-a-clean-book/1148455/
"Midsize private sector lender on Thursday reported a 29 per cent surge in the March quarter net at Rs 11.8 billion bolstered by high loan growth and a dip in dud which boosted its core interest income. For the fiscal year 2018-19, its net profit rose 26.9 per cent to Rs 42.2 billion.

At a time when the system is content at achieving a low double-digit credit growth, YES Bank’s stood at an impressive 53.9 per cent, which was the primary reason for pushing its net interest income up in the reporting quarter by 31 per cent to

Rs 21.5 billion.

Reflecting the hardening of the bond yields since last November, the non-interest income grew by a slower 13 per cent to Rs 14.2 billion.

Managing director and chief executive said has been broad-based, coming from both corporate and small medium businesses segments and added the reporting quarter saw doubling of its retail loan book, which now constitute 12 per cent the loan book. Kapoor said it is targeting to take it up to 40 per cent by March 2020.

On the asset quality front, the gross non-performing assets ratio narrowed to 1.28 per cent 1.72 per cent.

The bank also made a disclosure on divergences, or under-reporting of NPAs that had bloated the dud asset pile in the preceding quarter.

Of the over Rs 60. billion of under-reporting discovered by the regulator for FY17, 38 per cent has seen a recovered, 21 per cent has become standard, 11 per cent has slipped into NPAs while the remaining has turned into a security receipts post sale to asset reconstruction companies, Kapoor said.

The overall provisions increased to Rs 399 crore from Rs 309 crore and Kapoor said the bank is targeting to trim down credit cost to 0.50-0.70 per cent range for the fiscal 2019 from 0.76 per cent recorded in FY18.

It is also targeting to increase its provision coverage ratio to 60 per cent from 50 per cent now.

The bank had minimal impact from the change in recognition norms introduced on February 12 this year, he said, adding the emergence of frauds has led it to classify the gems & jewellery sector to the list of sensitive sectors.

He said the bank is focusing on increasing its market share in the current times, when a majority of lenders are fraught with internal issues like frauds, NPAs etc.

On its exposure to the troubled Fortis Healthcare, Kapoor said the total due is over Rs 1,500 crore and has been classified as ""standard"" in its books and added it has sufficient securities to cover the exposure.

The bank has an exposure of Rs 440 crore to the group's Reliance Naval, whose auditors yesterday had raised concerns on the viability of its business as a ""going concern"", Kapoor said, stressing that it has adequate securities in the account.

Net interest margin was almost stable at 3.4 per cent for the reporting quarter, while the share of low-cost Casa deposits grew to 36 per cent.

Even though it is well-capitalised with an overall buffer of over 18 per cent, the bank board has decided to raise up to USD 1 billion in core equity, Kapoor said, adding it may consider raising the money by the end of the FY19 if it sees some opportunities for its use.

"LoUs, now banned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), were issued as an undertaking that the issuer will honour a lender’s obligations if the borrower fails to do so.

Punjab National Bank (PNB) has honoured letters of undertaking (LoUs) related to transactions by defaulters Nirav Modi and Mehul

Choksi worth $1.9 billion (Rs 12,680 crore). Banks that were owed money by the lender have been paid, non-executive chairman Sunil Mehta told FE, adding that the remaining LoUs will be honoured on maturity. Mehta said around Rs 6,500 crore worth of LoUs had matured by the end of March.

“These have been paid and the ones maturing in April have been honoured. The total amount that has been paid out is about $1.9 billion of $2.07 billion,” Mehta added. LoUs, now banned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), were issued as an undertaking that the issuer will honour a lender’s obligations if the borrower fails to do so. While bank guarantees are internationally-accepted instruments, LoUs were mostly issued by banks in India and used by importers to raise money from foreign branches of Indian banks.

According to Mehta, since the number of LoUs issued fraudulently were substantial, the bank had to go back a number of years to make sure they have been reconciled.

“We also wanted to make sure whatever they had done there was prima facie kosher so that at least we were not violating any local regulations by honouring those,” he said.

PNB, Mehta said, has started linking its SWIFT system with the core banking system and will complete the process by April 30. “The way you do it is on a module-by-module basis; so we started the whole process soon after and we have committed that it will be complete by April 30. Every module has to be retested to validate that the module is working and that process is under way,” he added.

Mehta explained that while the bank had allocated a lot of its resources to tackle the damage following the fraud,its credit growth has not taken a beating in the March quarter of FY18. “Credit growth so far has been in the region of 10% for FY17-18 and that is good in terms of industry average,” he said, adding that while there was a little bit of a flutter in deposits when the fraud was disclosed, its current account and savings account deposits (CASA) as a percentage total deposits is 43.9%.

RBI data showed that growth in non-food bank credit dropped to 10.5% year-on-year during the fortnight ended March 30 from 11.39% in the previous fortnight.

“Our deposits have also grown. Maybe there was a few thousands of crore of deposits that should have come but we are at a very comfortable deposit growth,” Mehta said.

In February, PNB had disclosed that it was duped by companies associated with Modi and Choksi aided by a few junior officers of the bank. According to the lender’s complaint to investigating agencies, the junior officers had been issuing fraudulent LoUs without registering them on the bank’s books.

According to a first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), a deputy general manager in the bank’s Mumbai zonal office had filed a complaint with the CBI stating that Nirav Modi, Nishal Modi, Ami Nirav Modi and Mehul Chinubhai Choksi, all partners of Diamond R US, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds, in conspiracy with officials of PNB, cheated the bank and caused a loss of Rs 280.70 crore in 2017.

"To be sure, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s March quarter results took some of the steam out of its stock. It closed 2% lower, as costs weighed on profits. While net revenues were higher on the back of skyrocketing sales that beat industry growth rates, net profit fell significantly short of Bloomberg estimates, with margins too being squeezed. It’s a disappointment for investors.

That said, here’s why the rich valuation of its stock that trades at 22 times the estimated earnings for FY2020, is unlikely to ebb in the near term:

The cost pressures that dragged net profit down during the March quarter are mostly one-offs. Adverse foreign exchange movements increased royalty payments to its parent, Suzuki Motor Corp. Being the last quarter of the year, changes in gratuity and variable pay led to higher employee costs, which expanded by 50 basis points as a percentage of sales, when compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, new launches and the annual Auto Expo led to higher advertising and marketing costs, while higher power and fuel costs too added to inflated expenses.

These expenses hurt the operating margin. At 14.2%, it was only a shade better than a year ago, but fell drastically short of Bloomberg’s forecast of 15.5%.

Add to this the huge jump in interest costs during the quarter, which too was a one-off expense towards dues paid to landowners of the Manesar plant as compensation, according to court orders. This was not all. The quarter also saw a higher tax outgo. That the net profit of Rs1,818 crore therefore missed analysts’ forecasts is not surprising.

Investors should realize that most of the cost pressures, barring that of rising raw material costs, are one-offs. Besides, there are positives that could back Maruti’s premium valuation on the Street. The management appears confident that the firm would continue to beat industry growth rates. Maruti has posted double-digit growth in sales volumes over the last four years.

Further, the firm’s strategic shift into higher-end vehicles in the last couple of years will lead to better realizations that could support margins. Its nimble-footed product launches have helped reduce the discounts offered. The average discount per vehicle of Rs13,880 during the March quarter was a huge cutback from earlier quarters, underscoring its brand equity amid stiff competition. Of course, the utility vehicle business that it has recently ventured into is likely to add to marketing costs.

Topping all this is the news that the company has revised the terms of royalty, where for all new models Maruti would pay its parent royalty in rupee terms and also be reimbursed with some margin for research and development work in India. This implies lower royalty in the quarters ahead and lower risk of foreign exchange fluctuations, which in turn would lower the risk to profit margins.

In other words, while the March quarter had several misses on profit and profit margins, it is unlikely to shake investor confidence in the stock.",business,https://www.livemint.com/Money/aez7UqmifJ3VFAZ84Ww3YJ/Maruti-Suzukis-March-quarter-earnings-miss-wont-dent-its-v.html

This was not all. The quarter also saw a higher tax outgo. That the net profit of Rs1,818 crore therefore missed analysts’ forecasts is not surprising.

Investors should realize that most of the cost pressures, barring that of rising raw material costs, are one-offs. Besides, there are positives that could back Maruti’s premium valuation on the Street. The management appears confident that the firm would continue to beat industry growth rates. Maruti has posted double-digit growth in sales volumes over the last four years.

Further, the firm’s strategic shift into higher-end vehicles in the last couple of years will lead to better realizations that could support margins. Its nimble-footed product launches have helped reduce the discounts offered. The average discount per vehicle of Rs13,880 during the March quarter was a huge cutback from earlier quarters, underscoring its brand equity amid stiff competition. Of course, the utility vehicle business that it has recently ventured into is likely to add to marketing costs.

Topping all this is the news that the company has revised the terms of royalty, where for all new models Maruti would pay its parent royalty in rupee terms and also be reimbursed with some margin for research and development work in India. This implies lower royalty in the quarters ahead and lower risk of foreign exchange fluctuations, which in turn would lower the risk to profit margins.

In other words, while the March quarter had several misses on profit and profit margins, it is unlikely to shake investor confidence in the stock.",business,https://www.livemint.com/Money/aez7UqmifJ3VFAZ84Ww3YJ/Maruti-Suzukis-March-quarter-earnings-miss-wont-dent-its-v.html

"NEW DELHI: Higher sales and demand for fat-margin models saw Maruti Suzuki report a 10% growth in net profit in the fourth quarter of 2017-18 at Rs 1,882.1 crore against Rs 1,710 crore in the same period of 2016-17.The growth in net came in even as the company’s tax expenses went up.Net sales during the reported quarter rose to Rs 20,594 crore, up 14% against the year-ago period.Sales volume in the fourth quarter surged 11% to 4,61,773 as demand swelled for models such as Vitara mini SUV, Baleno and Swift hatchbacks.For the full year ended March 31, the company posted its highest-ever annual net at Rs 7,722 crore, up 5% from Rs 7,350 crore in the previous year. Net sales in 2017-18 stood at Rs 78,104 crore, up 17% from 2016-17.Commenting on the rise in net profit during the year, Maruti chairman R S Bhargava said, “Compared to last year, the effective tax rates went up by about 3%. Instead of 26% earlier, it has gone up to 29%.”Other items that put pressure on Maruti’s balance sheet included an outgo of around Rs 255 crore for resolving a land issue in Manesar, Bhargava said.The company also faced cost pressure, including rise in commodity prices, forcing the company to shell out Rs 700 crore extra during 2017-18 on various items, including steel and aluminium.“Despite all this, we have done better during the year in all aspects. Our market share has gone up by 2.7% to 50% in the passenger vehicles segment,” Bhargava said. The company’s board also gave its in-principle approval for establishing an employee welfare fund, and a trust to promote scientific research and technology in India.Bhargava said a new royalty payment formula has been approved, which would result in lower royalty payment outgo for the company. Under the new formula, royalty would be calculated in rupee terms and there would be a discount on the royalty after a certain volume, and the expenses done by Maruti in product development would also be reimbursed.“It has been applied to three new models — Ignis, Swift and Dzire. These models will now be subject to new formula. The expectation is that by 2021, all Maruti models would come under this formula, resulting in royalty percentage figure coming down from the current 5.4%,” Bhargava said. He added that the figure is expected to go down under 5% (of net sales) going ahead.",business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/maruti-suzuki-q4-net-rises-10-to-rs-1882-crore/articleshow/63947187.cms
"Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest passenger vehicle maker, reported a 10% growth in its net profit for Q4FY18.

Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest passenger vehicle maker, reported a 10% growth in its net profit for Q4FY18, but missed Street estimates as higher effective tax rates and expensing of a part of additional payments to landowners (Rs 250.70 crore) impacted its bottomline. The company’s shares closed 2% down on the BSE on Friday.

The Indian arm of Japanese auto-maker Suzuki closed the fourth quarter of FY18 with a net profit of Rs 1,882 crore, against Rs 1,711 crore for the same period last year. However, viewed from an operating perspective, the performance looks better. The earnings before interest, depreciation, tax and amortisation (EBIDTA) grew 18% to Rs 3,015 crore in the fourth quarter this year from Rs 2,560 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. EBIDTA margins too improved to 14.24% from 12.34%. The operating EBIT grew still faster at 24.4% in Q4FY18 over the same period last year.

The company said that the key reasons for margin movement were cost reduction efforts, partially offset by adverse commodity prices. Maruti Suzuki chairman RC Bhargava told a news channel that commodity costs have gone up and that royalty for the year came down to 5.4% from 5.8% (in the last quarter the royalty was higher due to a stronger yen), leading to impact on margins.

During the quarter, the company reported a 14.4% growth in its net sales Rs 20,594 crore against Rs 18,005 crore in the same period last year. This was aided by an 11.4% growth in vehicle sales volumes to 461,773 vehicles.

For the full year, Maruti Suzuki reported a growth of 5% in its standalone net profit to Rs 7,722 crore against Rs 7,350 crore in the preceding fiscal. “Increase in effective tax rates and lower non-operating income due to mark-to-market impact on the invested surplus, compared to last year impacted net profit,” said the company.

“The operating profit was Rs 9,304 crore, a growth of 20.1% over the same period previous year on account of higher sales volume, and cost reduction efforts, partially offset by adverse commodity prices,” the company said.

“India is one of the key markets for Suzuki and hence Maruti’s performance is critical for them. It is the market they are doing well in,” said VG Ramakrishnan, founder partner and MD, Avanteum Advisors, an advisory and consulting firm focused on key sectors including automobiles.

Ammar Master, senior manager, LMC Automotive, said, “We believe Suzuki will continue to focus on India, strengthen its business in China, expand products in ASEAN, and sustain volumes in Japan.”

Net sales for FY18 standalone stood at Rs 78,105 crore, a growth of 17% over the same period last year. The operating EBIT grew by 20.1% in FY18 over the same period last year. On a consolidated basis, the company reported a net profit of Rs 7,881 crore against Rs 7,511 crore for the same period last year, a growth of 5%.

During the year, Haryana State Industrial & Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) has revised the demands to Rs 972 crore, after adjusting Rs 374 crore paid by the company under protest in earlier years. In an earlier year, pursuant to courts orders, HSIIDC had raised demands on the company, amounting to Rs 1,032 crore towards payment of enhanced compensation to landowners its land at Manesar, Haryana. During the last quarter the company cleared the demands by paying Rs 923 crore, of which Rs 250.7 crore has been charged to the P&L for the quarter.

The board of directors recommended a dividend of Rs 80 per share of face value Rs 5 for FY18.

The board of directors also gave its in-principle approval to set up two funds to commemorate the 35-year anniversary of the company. These are Employee Welfare Fund and a trust to promote scientific research and technology in India. The details of the fund and the trust are yet to be worked out, but once they are set up, MSIL will contribute 1% of the profit after tax of the previous year each to the fund and the trust.",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/maruti-q4-profit-rises-10-operating-metrics-improve/1148505/
"Bengaluru: Amazon Inc has trimmed the growth of losses from its international business in the first quarter of 2018, marking a reversal of the ballooning costs incurred in previous quarters primarily on account of investments in India. The focus on India, however, will continue, according to a top company executive who said, “We like the momentum we’ve seen there.”The Jeff Bezos-founded company is reportedly in the fray to buy out rival Flipkart — India’s largest online retailer — which is also negotiating an aggressive bid by global retail behemoth Walmart for a majority stake.“We’ll continue to invest in India where we’re seeing great progress with both sellers and also customers,” Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky said during a quarterly earnings call on Thursday.The Seattle-based online retail giant also announced that subscription fees for Amazon Prime , its select service, will increase by a fifth in the US, a move that industry experts reckon could be replicated in India if Amazon were to become the only big player.Amazon said losses at the end of March 2018 reached $622 million, a rise of only 29% — far lower than the year-on-year jump in losses in the previous quarters, especially the 297% increase recorded in the first quarter of 2017.Analysts are of the view that the dip in losses in the March quarter does not necessarily indicate any slowdown in spending by Amazon in India, it merely reflects the fact that the company had invested heavily to build infrastructure and to discount prices in 2017.“This quarter does not reflect a trend,” said Satish Meena, forecast analyst at Forrester.“Amazon’s spending is expected to pick up in the next few quarters, especially during the festive season,” said Forrester’s Meena.Global sales grew at a faster rate in this quarter compared with the previous quarters as Amazon deepened the battle to get ahead of Flipkart in the coveted Indian online retail market.The American company’s international sales increased 34.5% to $14.8 billion from $11 billion in the same period last year. This was faster than the 29% growth in the December quarter and the 15-16% growth in the first two quarters of 2017.Meena said Amazon’s expansion into new countries, especially with Prime, would have also boosted international sales.In a letter to shareholders last week, Bezos marked out India as a ‘milestone’, stating that Amazon. in is the fastest growing marketplace in India. He said Prime added more members in India in its first year than it had in any other geography previously.The Prime selection in India now includes more than 40 million local products from third party sellers, and Prime Video is investing in original Indian content in a big way, Bezos said in the letter.The same point was reiterated during the earnings call on Thursday, when the company announced a hike in fees for Prime membership in the US by 20% to $119.“We are also adding other Prime benefits (in India). We’re rolling out devices there, and we’re seeing Indian developers developing skills for Alexa,” said Amazon’s Olsavsky.Experts said that if Amazon prevails in its bid to acquire Flipkart, the potential lack of competition may lead the Seattle company to hike prices in the Indian market as it did with its Prime fees in the US.“It (Amazon) will do what it has done in the US and raise prices, with the cost of Prime having been increased by 20% just this week.And it will start raising prices on all other merchandise while it puts local players out of business,” said Vivek Wadhwa, fellow, Carnegie Mellon University Engineering at Silicon Valley.“Amazon is trying to replicate the success it achieved in the US in India. It wants to be the dominant player in ecommerce,” he said.Amazon has been investing heavily to build infrastructure to boost Prime deliveries and selection, growing its total capacity by 50% over last year. It now has 67 fulfilment centres across 13 states that enable faster deliveries on Prime.The January-March quarter saw Amazon launch its Prime music streaming service in India, after introducing its Alexa smart speakers here.In 2017, Amazon’s international loss hit a record $3 billion, more than doubling from $1.28 billion in 2016, while international sales jumped to $54 billion from $43.9 billion.",business,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/amazons-global-sales-grow-faster-in-q1-losses-remain-high-on-india-investments/articleshow/63934531.cms

With AWS Secrets Manager, customers can easily rotate, manage, and retrieve secrets — such as database credentials and API keys — in the AWS Cloud, on third-party services, and on-premises.

AWS announced Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) One Zone-Infrequent Access (Z-IA) and general availability of Amazon S3 Select. Amazon S3 Z-IA is a new storage class that stores objects in a single Availability Zone and is designed for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience model of other S3 storage classes. Amazon S3 Select enables customers to retrieve only the data they need from an object, which can dramatically improve the performance and reduce the cost of applications that need to access data in S3.

AWS launched the general availability of Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Translate, two new machine learning services which are part of the AWS machine learning portfolio. Amazon Transcribe provides grammatically correct transcriptions of audio files to allow audio data to be analyzed, indexed, and searched.

"By Supantha Mukherjee

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's 20 percent hike in the cost of Prime membership should deliver more than $1 billion in extra revenue this year and cover any ""rational"" hike in United States Postal Service delivery fees, Wall Street analysts said on Friday.

President Donald Trump has been laying into the Seattle-based online shopping firm in recent weeks for what he says is a deal with publicly-owned USPS which effectively lumps much of the cost of thousands of daily deliveries onto U.S. taxpayers.

Trump has said that if USPS raised parcel rates, Amazon would face $2.6 billion in extra cost, although equity analysts who follow billionaire Jeff Bezos' company estimate a much lower number and say the deal may actually be keeping USPS afloat.

Several said that Thursday's move by the company to raise Prime fees to $119 a year from $99 starting June 16 would not faze many of Prime's estimated 60-65 million U.S. members.

""The incremental $20 membership fee could result in an incremental $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of revenue which should more than offset any rational USPS price increase,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said.

Shares of the company were up 7.4 percent to a record high of $1630 in premarket trading on Friday as investors lauded another blockbuster quarter that delivered profits of $1.6 billion and revenue of $51 billion.

""Amazon delivered a humongous quarter, with faster growth and higher profitability than Street projections and followed up with a one-two punch by announcing it was raising annual Prime membership fee,"" Deutsche Bank Lloyd Walmsley said.

The 20 percent hike was the second time Amazon had increased its Prime subscription fee since the launch of the service in 2005.

The service, crucial in driving purchases of both goods and digital media on Amazon, gives members free delivery, access to movies and original series through Prime Video, on-demand music streaming and free books on Prime Reading.

That appears to put it on a collision course with Netflix and Apple in the streaming market - but analysts say Bezos is more interested in how the appeal of the service props up his retail empire.

Amazon disclosed last week it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally and commentators said it would likely raise prices outside of the United States as well.

""So far there is no word on international price hikes but with the expansion of shipping services and content worldwide, it wouldn't be unreasonable to see them,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.

"The program will soon cost $20 more for new subscribers.

Amazon is increasing the price of Prime.

The e-commerce giant will start charging $20 more for its membership program, which includes perks such as two-day shipping and access to video and music streaming libraries. The new price, $119, will go into effect May 11 for new subscribers, CFO Brian Olsavsky announced Thursday during the company's quarterly earnings call with investors. Existing members will be charged the higher price beginning June 16 as their accounts become eligible for renewal.

""The value of Prime to customers has never been greater,"" Olsavsky told investors. ""And the cost is also high, as we pointed out especially with shipping options and digital benefits, we continue to see rises in costs.""

Amazon has charged $99 annually for Prime since 2014, when it upped the price from $79 a year. (It increased the price of its monthly Prime membership in January from $11 to $13, or the equivalent of $156 a year.)

In the years since Prime's last major price hike, Amazon has invested heavily to grow the benefits of the subscription, such as spending $4.5 billion on content last year — including producing such originals as Transparent and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and licensing programming from other networks. Amazon also recently spent $250 million for the rights to a Lord of the Rings television series, and on Thursday announced that it had renewed its deal with the NFL for the streaming rights to the Thursday Night Football programming package.

Olsavsky noted the changes to Prime, including the growth in the number of products available for two-day and same-day delivery. Prime, he said, ""is much different than it was in 2014."" The exec also noted the global expansion of the membership program into regions such as India.

Amazon announced last week that it has 100 million Prime subscribers around the world. It did not break out how many of those people watch video or stream music.",business,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/amazon-increases-price-prime-1106284?utm_source=twitter&utm_source=Direct
"Amazon AMZN, +3.60% raised the annual fee for its Prime membership program for the first time since 2014 — but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s less of a bargain for most consumers.

The online retailer announced that it will hike the annual fee for a Prime membership in the U.S. by 20% to $119. The change comes as Amazon revealed that it now has more than 100 million people globally who are members of the program. In January, Amazon raised the price of monthly memberships from $10.99 to $12.99 per month. The price change will go into effect starting May 11 for new members and starting June 16 for existing members when they renew.

Amazon said that it was upping the price of a Prime membership to offset the costs the program incurs, thanks to free shipping and digital content streaming. “Since we increased the U.S. annual price of Prime four years ago both the value of Prime and the cost to offer it have increased significantly,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in an email. “We still believe that Prime is disproportionately more valuable than the fee.”

But consumers who are considering Prime—and those who are already members—will need to closely evaluate whether the membership is still worth it at the higher price. Ultimately, that decision will come down to how much benefit each individual consumer derives from the program, whose perks range from free two-day shipping on Amazon purchases to free online photo storage and free audiobooks from Audible.

“It’s easy to go on autopilot and renew your membership for these programs,” said Robert Harrow, head of credit-card research at personal-finance website ValuePenguin.com. “But if you’re not the type of consumer who takes advantage of all these services, it may not be worth it.”

Here’s how the benefits of an Amazon Prime membership shake out at the new price point:

Free shipping isn’t what it used to be

First and foremost, for those who do the majority of their shopping online, the free delivery options can theoretically pay for the cost of a Prime membership themselves. As an example, the cost of two-day shipping (which comes free with a Prime membership) for an external hard drive adds up to more than $11. So after just 10 two-day shipments, a Prime membership could pay for itself.

Prime members can also get free same-day, two-hour and release date delivery in many parts of the country if their order meets certain specifications. Recently, Amazon Prime members got a new benefit: Free two-hour grocery delivery from select Whole Foods locations.

While Prime’s free shipping options once set it apart, today it stands out less in this regard. Competitors have followed Amazon’s example. Walmart WMT, -0.74% has introduced free two-day shipping for millions of items online if the order is $35 or more.

And research has shown that Prime members double their spending on Amazon relative to non-Prime members, perhaps in order to justify the cost of membership. Depending on whether that increases a person’s spending overall, a Prime membership could easily become a budget buster.

Plus, many consumers have a Prime membership to take advantage of free shipping for holiday shopping, Harrow said. But these people may be better off without an annual membership. “They should consider canceling Prime for the year and just signing up for the months they use it,” he said.

Access to online content alone could make a Prime membership a bargain

The content-oriented perks alone could pay for a Prime membership. For starters, through Prime Video, members have free or low-cost access to thousands of TV shows and movies — including critically-acclaimed shows like the Amazon-produced “Transparent” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” And music-lovers have free access to more than a million songs via Prime Music.

Meanwhile, Netflix NFLX, -0.71% costs $11 a month for its standard plan, which includes HD streaming and the ability to watch content on two screens simultaneously, and Hulu costs the same price for its commercial-free service. On the music side, Spotify SPOT, +2.16% costs $10 a month, and Pandora P, +0.37% offers ad-free music streaming for $3.99 per month.

Granted, competitors such as Netflix or Spotify might have more popular or extensive catalogs. Therefore, consumers shouldn’t evaluate the value of Prime Video or Prime Music based on price alone. “This largely comes down to personal taste and what people prefer,” Harrow said. In other words, if someone doesn’t like the content available on Amazon, then it’s not worth it.

And then there are all the unused freebies

In a thread on Reddit discussing Amazon Prime’s value in light of the price hike, many users were surprised to learn that they could get access to free video-game streams and discounts on games via Twitch Prime. Prime members without a Kindle or Fire tablet or the Kindle app on other mobile devices may not be taking advantage of the books and magazines they have access to.

Similarly, the discounts that members can get at Whole Foods are virtually worthless if someone doesn’t live near one.

Those benefits have a value if people actually use them. For instance, getting one free e-book per month through the Kindle library would equate to a $42 savings, according to CreditCards.com.

“When it comes to all these free things, people need to be realistic about whether they will actually use them,” said Harrow. “If you don’t take advantage of these things, then it’s not a good value.”

Fitch said GST is an important reform that would support growth in the medium term when teething issues dissipate.“India’s five-year average real GDP growth of 7.1% is the highest in the APAC region and among ‘BBB’ range peers.

"Fitch joins Standard and Poor’s in retaining India’s rating at BBB–, with a stable outlook.

Fitch Ratings on Friday kept its sovereign rating for India unchanged at the lowest investment grade of BBB-, with a stable outlook, having denied the country an upgrade for 12 years now.

The global rating agency cited “weak” fiscal position and “some lagging structural factors, including governance standards and a still-difficult, but improving, business environment” for the status quo. However, it has acknowledged India’s strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balance. Last month, the finance ministry had pitched for a rating upgrade with Fitch officials.

Fitch joins Standard and Poor’s in retaining India’s rating at BBB–, with a stable outlook. However, Moody’s Investors Service raised its sovereign rating for the country from the lowest investment grade of Baa3 to Baa2, and upgraded the outlook from stable to positive in November last year – for the first time in around 14 years, as it expected continued progress on economic and institutional reform would boost India’s high growth potential.

“Weak fiscal balances, the Achilles’ heel in India’s credit profile, continue to constrain its ratings. General government debt amounted to 69% of GDP in FY18, while fiscal slippage of 0.3% of GDP in both FY18 and FY19 relative to the government’s own budget targets of last year, implies a general government deficit of 7.1% of GDP,” Fitch said in a statement, which remained in sync with its earlier stance.

The agency said the Centre’s target to gradually trim its own fiscal deficit from 3.5% in FY18 to 3% of the GDP by March 2021 is “well beyond its current electoral term”. It added that the government’s longer-term aim of keeping a ceiling for central government debt at 40% of GDP and general government debt at 60% of GDP (to be reached by March 2025) is a positive step, if eventually adhered to.

India’s relatively strong external buffers and the comparatively closed nature of its economy make it less vulnerable to external shocks vis-a-vis many of its peers. However, falling net FDI inflows at $23.7 billion in the first three quarters of FY18 from $30.6 billion a year earlier are “insufficient” to cover a widening current account deficit, unlike in many of India’s peers, the agency warned.

Fitch said public sector banks could need more capital infusion by the government than $32 billion planned by it, especially after the $2.2- billion fraud at Punjab National Bank. “Most of the capital injection is likely to be absorbed by losses associated with NPL (non-performing loan) resolution, rather than to fund new lending. Fitch expects the sector-wide NPL ratio to rise to 11.5% of total loans by end-FY18, up from 4.6% in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards,” it said.",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/fitch-ratings-denies-india-an-upgrade-again/1148525/
"NEW DELHI: Fitch has kept India’s rating unchanged with a stable outlook, saying the rating balances a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with weak fiscal finances and some lagging structural factors, including governance standards and a still-difficult, but improving, business environment.The agency affirmed India’s rating at BBB-, which is at the junk bond or lowest investment grade with a stable outlook. Last year Moody’s Investors Service had upgraded India’s sovereign rating after a gap of nearly 14 years, while Standard & Poor’s retained its BBB- rating with a stable outlook. A rating upgrade changes the profile of the country and makes it attractive to investors.The stable outlook reflects Fitch’s assessment that upside and downside risks to ratings are broadly balanced. The main factors that, individually or collectively, could trigger positive rating action are: A reduction in general government debt over the medium term to a level closer to that of rated peers and higher sustained investment and growth rates, without the creation of macro imbalances, such as from successful structural reform implementation.The government had pitched for a rating upgrade, citing its reform record as well as rebound in economic growth but the agency has preferred to remain cautious.Fitch said a favourable economic growth outlook continues to support India’s credit profile and forecast growth to rebound to 7.3% in FY19 and 7.5% in FY20, as a temporary drag will fade from the withdrawal of large-denomination bank notes in November 2016 and the introduction of GST in July last year.“The GST is likely to support growth in medium term once teething issues dissipate. India’s five-year average real GDP growth of 7.1% is the highest in APAC region and among ‘BBB’ range peers. Growth has the potential to remain high for a substantial period of time, as convergence with more developed economies can be expected,” the agency said.",business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/fitch-retains-indias-rating-at-bbb-with-stable-outlook/articleshow/63947158.cms

"The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) started an inspection on Friday into the filings made by Nupower Renewables, a company owned by Deepak Kochhar, since its inception in 2008, for violations of the Act, if any.

The MCA’s Mumbai office has sought details of investments made into the company, including by Videocon, and sought valuation reports based on which it received investments from overseas.

The inspection of documents by MCA started after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) started a preliminary enquiry into the company getting a Rs 640-million loan received from Videocon Industries after ICICI Bank extended a Rs 32-billion loan to the latter in 2012. The probe will cover all the entities related to NuPower and its promoter, including Pacific Capital Services, Pinnacle Trust and Supreme Energy. Deepak Kochhar is married to ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar.

The investments by the Kanodia family of Datamatics into Nupower’s compulsorily cumulative convertible preference shares (CCPS) via a Mauritius-based entity is also under the scanner. The Kanodias invested Rs 3.25 billion in NuPower in 2011 and 2012, and exited two years later without making any profit or loss.

The Kanodias sold their shares in NuPower to Mauritius-based DH Renewables, which in turn, is owned by Accion Diversified Strategies Fund of Cayman Island. The ultimate investors of DH Renewables and Accion are not known to regulatory authorities. DH Renewables converted the CCPS into NuPower’s equity shares, based on a valuation done by Price Waterhouse in December 2016.

In a statement on March 28, the ICICI Bank board had given a clean chit to its MD. The board was, however, not informed about the investment made by Kanodia-owned Firstland Holdings of Mauritius, as it was not violating any conflict of interest guideline, a source close to the development said.

The NuPower matter is currently under investigation by multiple regulators. The market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), is looking into possible lapses of disclosure and corporate governance norms by ICICI Bank. The regulator has sought documents from the bank on decisions of its board of directors on the loan.

The income-tax department has also written to the governments of Mauritius and Cayman Island, seeking details on the investors of NuPower. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has started an enquiry into the loan sanctioned to the Videocon group and others by ICICI Bank, which was part of a consortium of lenders.

The ED has written to the Sebi, seeking information on the Videocon group. It also asked for details of the investigation into the group’s activities in the past few years — especially investments made by DH Renewables. The enforcement agency will also approach the Reserve Bank of India for details on disclosures by ICICI Bank about its dealings with Videocon.

"ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar attended an event in Mumbai titled India Economic Summit. (File photo) ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar attended an event in Mumbai titled India Economic Summit. (File photo)

The MD and CEO of ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar on Friday who made her first public appearance since the CBI registered a preliminary enquiry against firms controlled by her husband Deepak Kocchar and Venugopal Dhoot, promoter of Videocon Group following allegations of a possible conflict of interest in the Rs 3,250-crore loan granted by ICICI Bank to Videocon Group in 2012 chose not to comment on the ongoing controversy.

Kochhar attended an event in Mumbai titled India Economic Summit, jointly organised by India Foundation, a think-tank run by Shaurya Doval, son of National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval and the BSE.

Kocchar was first of the many prominent guests to arrive at the event and was immediately escorted to the VIP room at the convention hall of BSE Ltd by Ashish Chauhan, CEO of BSE. Later D R Kaarthikeyen, former CBI director, Jayant Sinha, Minister of State for Civil Aviation and Sanjiv Sanyal, Principal Economic Advisor in the Ministry of Finance joined her in the VIP room , where they were all together for about 15 minutes. Shaurya Doval and Vallabh Bhansali, chairman of ENAM Group too dropped by in the VIP room.

Outside the VIP room, at least three security guards of BSE and four people from the official public relations agency of ICICI Bank ensured that no media persons were allowed inside the VIP room during the meeting.

During the summit, when The Indian Express approached Kochhar for a comment on the ongoing controversy involving Deepak Kochhar’s firms, Videocon and the loans disbursed by ICICI Bank, she did not respond. Eventually, Kochhar who was seated in the front row next to investment banker, Hemendra Kothari, left midway through the conference without interacting with the media persons at the event.

Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal were also present on the first day of the two-day summit.

On March 29, The Indian Express had reported that in December 2008, Dhoot set up a company called NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) with Deepak Kochhar and two relatives; then gave a Rs 64-crore loan to this company through a fully owned entity before he transferred the latter’s ownership to a trust headed by Deepak Kochhar for just Rs 9 lakh.

The transfer of the company to Deepak Kochhar happened six months after the Videocon Group got a loan of Rs 3,250 crore from ICICI Bank, raising questions of propriety and conflict of interest. Almost 86 per cent of that loan (Rs 2,810 crore) remained unpaid and the Videocon account was declared an NPA in 2017.

Earlier, ICICI Bank had issued a press release saying “there is no question of any quid pro quo/ nepotism/ conflict of interest as is being alleged in various rumours.” It said the Board “reposes full faith” in Chanda Kochhar and added that “malicious and unfounded rumours” were being spread to “malign the Bank.”

The statement, however, did not address the specific query from The Indian Express on Deepak Kochchar-Venugopal Dhoot transactions or the conflict of interest. The board of ICICI Bank is scheduled to meet on May 7, to consider the FY18 financial results of the bank.

"Chanda Kochhar, the embattled chief of ICICI Bank, today made her maiden public appearance this evening after late last month reports emerged about allegations of conflict of interest involving her and her husband in extending loans to the Videocon Group.

The managing director and chief executive of the second largest private sector lender, however, did not make any comments at the short public appearance at the BSE. Dressed in a red-saree, Kochhar surprised the large posse of reporters by making an entry at an economic summit organised at the oldest stock bourse in Asia. The meeting had Union Cabinet ministers like Suresh Prabhu and Jayant Sinha and Maharashtra and Assam chief ministers as key speakers.

Kochhar occupied a front-row table at the International Convention Hall in the 28-sotrey BSE Towers (JJ Towers), which served as the chaotic trading floor in the pre-dematerialisation days and represented the spirit of desi enterprise. Veteran i-bankers Vallabh Bhansali and Hemendra Kothari, both of whom have sold their businesses nearly a decade ago, shared the table with Kochhar. All through her presence, Kochhar didn't have any long conversations with any of those present and also avoided the media. In the recent past, ever since the controversy over conflict of interest in extending Rs 3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2010 broke out and a lack of disclosures on the same arose, Kochhar has been conspicuously missing from public appearances.

She gave the miss to a big-ticket women's empowerment event organised by industry lobby Ficci in the national Capital which was addressed by President Ramnath Kovind early April and was also not present at the listing of the bank's investment banking arm ICICI Securities later in the middle of this month. The bank is set to announce its quarter results on May 7. Usually, Kochhar addresses the media telecon. The controversy relates to a Rs 3,250-cr loan from ICICI Bank to the Venugopal Dhoot-led Videocon Group in 2010 which since then turned dud. Dhoot set up a green energy company Nupower right before and soon after the loan was given Dhoot sold it to Deepak Kochhar, Chanda's husband who along with his relatives then gave a Rs 64-crore loan to this company through a fully-owned entity before transferring the ownership to a trust headed by Deepak Kochhar for a paltry sum of Rs 9 lakh.

The questions of propriety and conflict of interest come as the transfer of the company to Deepak Kochchar happened six months after the Videocon got the Rs 3,250 crore loan from ICICI Bank and almost 86 per cent of that loan (Rs 2,810 crore) remains unpaid and Videocon was declared bankrupt mid last year and is at the NCLT now. The national enforcement agencies CBI and ED are probing the case now.

"Mumbai, Apr 27 () Benchmark Sensex spurted by over 200 points for the second straight day today on across-the-board buying by participants as Asian markets cheered a historic summit between North and South Korea.

The 30-share Sensex rallied over 256 points to end at a near 3-month high of 34,969.70, while the broader Nifty advanced 74.50 points to 10,692.30 as the May derivatives series got off to a strong start.

The key indices gained for the fifth week in a row -- their longest winning streak in a year. The Sensex surged 554.12 points, or 1.61 per cent, while the Nifty gained 128.25 points, or 1.21 per cent, during this week.

The 30-stock Sensex opened positive and rallied to reclaim the 35,000-mark, touching the session's high of 35,065.37.

However, profit-booking at some counters trimmed the gains as the gauge settled 256.10 points or 0.74 per cent higher at 34,969.70 -- a level last seen on February 2 when it had concluded at 35,066.77.

The index had rallied 212.33 points in the previous session on the back of strong earnings amid positive global cues.

""Market edged higher owing to strong global market rally while good set of quarterly earnings lifted investors sentiment. The current rally outpaced the headwinds from rising oil price and rupee volatility.

""PSU bank outperformed on account of short covering while IT index witnessed profit booking after earnings led rally. US 10 year bond yield slid below 3 per cent marked by ease in geopolitical tensions supporting global market sentiments,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

Axis Bank emerged the top performer among Sensex constituents by surging 8.97 per cent even as the company yesterday reported a net loss of Rs 2,188.74 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

Meanwhile, domestic institutional investors (DIIs) net bought shares worth Rs 684.11 crore, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) offloaded to the tune of Rs 1,056.34 crore yesterday, provisional data showed.

The broader markets too displayed a firm trend as the BSE mid-cap index rose 0.79 per cent and the small-caps gained 0.42 per cent.

Among BSE sectoral indices, capital goods rose 1.40 per cent, PSU 1.25 per cent, oil and gas 1.05 per cent, healthcare 0.75 per cent, metal 0.61 per cent, realty 0.37 per cent, infrastructure 0.24 per cent, auto 0.24 per cent and FMCG 0.24 per cent.

"The committee of creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel will ask ArcelorMittal and Numetal to “cure” their bids as per the NCLT’s order

The committee of creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel, which met on Friday for the second time since the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) order on April 19, will ask ArcelorMittal and Numetal to “cure” their bids as per the NCLT’s order, bankers told FE.

“Today’s meeting was a procedural one,” one of the large lenders to Essar Steel who attended the meeting said, on condition of anonymity. “We will do what the NCLT has directed us to do. And we will wait for the hearing at the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) on May 17.”

In its April 19 order, the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT had asked Essar Steel’s CoC and resolution professional (RP) to reconsider the first set of bids received from Numetal and ArcelorMittal, granting an additional 30 days for the resolution process. It had suggested that the two bidders be allowed an opportunity to rectify their bids to make them eligible.

The NCLT had also observed that inviting a second round of bids without offering bidders an opportunity to rectify their bids was “prima facie invalid”.

The second round of bidding took place after the CoC disqualified the first set of bids received from ArcelorMittal and Numetal.

Since then, both ArcelorMittal and Numetal have moved the NCLAT. While ArcelorMittal has challenged the disqualification of its bids by the RP and the CoC, Numetal has challenged the NCLT’s order. The NCLAT said it would hear both the appeals on May 17. It has issued notices to the RP and the CoC on the matter.

Bankers are still divided in their opinion on this matter. Some of the lenders are in favour of inviting a fresh round of bid from all interested parties. JSW Steel and Vedanta are interested in Essar Steel. While Vedanta had bid for the beleaguered steelmaker in the second round, JSW could not submit a bid since it had not submitted an expression of interest in the first round. But it had joined hands with Numetal to bid for Essar Steel.

Sources close to Vedanta said that although the NCLT did not allow the second round of bids to be opened, it is still interested in acquiring Essar Steel and would bid for the asset given an opportunity. Sources close to the development are not ruling out another round of bidding, although a lot would depend on the NCLAT ruling.

The RP and the CoC had disqualified ArcelorMittal’s bid since it was considered a promoter of Uttam Galva Steels and KSS Petron, both loan defaulters. Numetal’s bid was held to be ineligible since one of the persons associated with the company, Rewant Ruia, is related to the promoters of Essar Steel. The shareholders of Numetal include Russia’s VTB Bank and engineering firm Tyazhpromexport, financial investor Aurora Enterprises (in which Ruia has an interest) and commodity trading company Indo International Trading.

Essar Steel’s RP is Satish Kumar Gupta. The lenders to Essar Steel include State Bank of India, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank and ICICI Bank. The company, which has a steel-making capacity of 9.7 million tonnes per annum, owes close to Rs 50,000 crore to lenders.",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/coc-of-essar-steel-to-give-bidders-chance-to-cure-bids/1148544/

"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday agreed to hear on 17 May cross petitions filed by disqualified Essar Steel Ltd bidders Numetal Ltd and ArcelorMittal India Ltd.

NCLAT issued notices to a committee of Essar Steel creditors, the resolution professional running the auction of the company and the two bidders on the cross petitions.

Numetal, backed by Russia’s VTB Capital, has challenged a company court order allowing rival ArcelorMittal to clear bank dues of associate companies so that it can become eligible to acquire Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal on the other hand has challenged its disqualification from bidding.

The cross petitions were mentioned before a bench of NCLAT which issued notices, replies and rejoinders to which are to be filed within a week.

Mukul Rohtagi, appearing for Numetal, argued that the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, which had disqualified ArcelorMittal from bidding to acquire Essar Steel on grounds that it was a promoter company of firms that had defaulted on payment of bank loans, had “erred” in permitting ArcelorMittal “to cure the ineligibility by making payment of the overdue amounts of Uttam Galva Steels Ltd and KSS Petron Pvt. Ltd” within 30 days. He sought the quashing of the NCLT order that directed the resolution professional and the committee of creditors of Essar Steel to “reconsider the resolution plan submitted by Arcelor Mittal India”.

"KOLKATA: One reached the city nearly a week ago and the second has already started its journey from Bengaluru. The remaining 12 BEML rakes for the East-West Metro corridor will follow in quick succession and reach the city by the end of this financial year, BEML chairman & managing director Deepak Kumar Hota told TOI on Friday.“These are world-class rakes and we now have the capacity at BEML to build one coach per day. The remaining 72 coaches will reach Kolkata by the end of this year. We are committed to provide world-class Metro services for Kolkata. At the moment, we don’t have any orders from Metro Railway for the new lines for which work is on but if they want our rakes, a tender process can be launched. However, the process could be simpler if Metro were to place a follow-up order,” Hota said.Nearly 20%-25% of BEML’s business is in the defence and aerospace sectors. BEML is working on missiles.“We also have a 25-acre SEZ plot in Bengaluru that we propose to use for the aerospace sector. Our aim is offsets and exports. We are already in talks with companies like HAL and Dassault. We are also working towards the development of high-speed trains. For the mining sector, we are developing 200-tonne high capacity dumpers and 180-tonne excavators that would run on diesel. These now run on electricity. ‘Make in India’ is a great concept and will aid in the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and strengthen the eco-system for vendors and suppliers. This not only aids in growth but also saves a lot of funds. In fact, we are now looking towards exports in a big way and have already held talks with 68 countries,” the BEML CMD said.Hota pointed out how BEML is extremely committed towards environment and generates nearly 400 lakh units of electricity through windmills and solar panels. The company’s peak demand is 360-380 lakh units. The remaining flows back to the grid.“We generate 23 MW from wind energy alone. Our carbon footprint is nearly zero. We have reduced travel a lot and rely a lot on video-conferencing. We have even done away with plastic bottles altogether. Financially, our turnover and profit has gone up over the last fiscal. We also have major tie-ups with institutions like IIT Kharagpur and IISc, Bangalore.

Calcutta: Metro Railway drivers seem to have shed their initial reluctance to switch to the East-West Metro after a written assurance from the railway authorities that their pay scales and job security won't be compromised.

Two drivers who had gone on sick leave after being selected for a transfer to the Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC) signalled their acceptance of the order on Friday by joining their new organisation, officials said.

They will be sent to Bangalore for a 17-week stint of training to operate the trains being manufactured by BEML for the East-West Metro. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation will arrange the training.

""We have requisitioned about 20 drivers from Metro Railway. They are expected to join in a week's time and will then undergo training in Bangalore,"" a KMRC official said.

Metro had reported on Wednesday about the East-West Metro struggling to find drivers eager to take a transfer from Metro Railway and undergo training to run its rakes. The first two drivers selected to join the KMRC had unofficially sought more clarity on the terms and conditions offered to them.

Officials said the duo had refused to shift from Metro Railway to the KMRC on grounds of the railway authorities allegedly not spelling out the terms and conditions of their service.

When Metro Railway had first given 35 drivers the option of a transfer to the KMRC, none accepted it.

""We did not know whether our pay scales and other benefits would be retained. But now that the authorities have given us an assurance about our future, we have no reason not to switch to the KMRC,"" said one of the drivers.

Sources said the KMRC had requisitioned 212 personnel, including drivers and technical personnel.",business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/calcutta/metro-duo-switch-tracks-226631

"The primary reason given to these employees was the lack of budgets.

It is appraisal time again and most companies in India have already started the evaluation process for their employees. For this, most organisations follow the bell curve system of management in which they compare employees’ performance relative to others and put them in different rankings – top, average and bottom performers. The employees expect it to make it to the top bracket, however, not all of them are able to. Were you also denied a pay hike? Then, here is a closer look at how appraisal time works in India.

According to a survey conducted by job site Indeed on employees across industrial sectors in India, more than half of the respondents stated that they had asked for a hike in the previous year, while a third said they had done so more than once during the same period of time, only to be refused.

The primary reason given to these employees was the lack of budgets. However, close to a third respondents were also told that their quality of work was not up to the mark. What comes as a major disappointment for most Indian employees is the fact that they are paid lower than other countries. The survey revealed that over 64% of respondents believe that Indian salaries are generally lower than the average.

Sashi Kumar, Managing Director, Indeed India, said that the priority for the organisations is that their expectations are met. “While wage growth continue to be the leading priorities for employees, it is imperative on part of organizations to ensure that employee expectations are met,” Kumar said.

“In today’s era of transparency and peer consultation, employees are far more informed about industry standards and company cultures. Millennial job seekers in particular – are today exploring highly aspirational career paths, and are not afraid of seeking greener pastures and newer experiences to further their professional goals and widen their horizons,” Kumar added.

However, this doesn’t stop Indian employees from asking for a pay hike. A total of 93% of the respondents possibly or definitely plan to ask for a pay raise in the coming appraisal cycle for 2018, with women more likely to ask for a raise than men.

The survey suggests that 67% of all women respondents confirmed that they would be asking for a pay raise in comparison to 64% of men.

The figures point towards two things – most employees are not satisfied with their current level of remuneration and more women than men are dissatisfied with their current pay. As many as 20% of women respondents believe that their male counterparts are being paid more than them, only 9% of men feel their female peers are being paid less than them.

Moreover, 80% of respondents agreed that they would consider changing their job in order to secure a pay rise, a majority of them being in the 25-34 age group. Even though 50% respondents cited their good work as a reason they should be rewarded, a significant faction also stated that the rising cost of living, the extra responsibilities and extra hours of work put in by them should be compensated.

Over 60% stated flexible work hours as an alternative to a pay hike, while 47% suggested an increase in annual leave. Close to 40% also cited paid parental leave as a benefit they would prefer, while 63% respondents asked for healthcare benefits instead of a pay raise.

Now, here is an interesting fact. Out of those who didn’t plan to ask for a pay hike, 43% claimed that their present salary was satisfactory.

The survey was conducted by Censuswide, a UK-based survey consultancy, on 2005 employees from companies across various sectors like IT, Telecom, Education, Manufacturing & Utilities, Finance and Healthcare. A majority of these participants were in the age group of 25-44 and in full-time occupations. The average length of employment at the current company was about 6 years. The average annual pay was a little over 6 lakh.",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/money/disappointed-with-your-appraisal-you-may-be-better-off-than-50-denied-pay-hike-last-year/1147954/
"When looked at number of persons covered—instead of just the premium paid—with 5.3 crore persons covered by the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and 13.47 crore by Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, the coverage looks better.

After the first few years of the decade when the business contracted, India’s insurance sector continues to grow well and the premium-to-GDP ratio was 3.5% in 2016, down from 5.2% in 2009 but up from 2.7% in 2001. When looked at number of persons covered—instead of just the premium paid—with 5.3 crore persons covered by the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana and 13.47 crore by Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, the coverage looks better. During FY18, the first-year life-insurance premiums rose 16.3% on top of 20.9% in FY17 and 12.3% in FY16. Interestingly, for the first time since the sector was opened to private players in 2000, the share of LIC went to below half at 49.1%.

What has driven life insurance growth over the last few years has been the surge in sales of Unit-Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs), especially for the new players. In the case of SBI Life, these rose from 44% in 2012 to 69% in Q3FY18, from 12% to 65% for Bajaj Life, 56% to 86% for ICICI Prudential and 12% to 41% in the case of Max Life. For the industry as a whole, the share of ULIPs in total insurance has risen from 8% in FY14 to 12% in FY17.

The other part of the increasing financialisation of India’s savings, of course, is the growth in the mutual fund industry, where equity inflows have risen from Rs 79,000 crore in FY15 to as much as Rs 233,900 crore in FY18. As a result of this, the share of India’s household savings being held in financial form rose from 7.4% of GDP in FY12 to 8.2% in FY16, before falling to 6.8% in FY17. Since India’s overall savings of the household sector also fell in this period, from 23.6% of GDP in FY12 to 16.3% in FY17, what is more relevant is the composition of the savings. From 31.3% in FY12, the share of household savings held in financial form rose from 31.3% to 46% in FY16 and then fell to 41.7% in FY17. An issue that the government would probably need to examine, in the light of the latest budget, though, is the distortion caused by the new proposal to tax shares and equity mutual funds at a 10% rate for long-term capital gains. While this makes sense given bank interest rates are taxed at the marginal rate of tax for every group, there is no tax on ULIPs which, in addition, also get benefits under Section 80C. Also, while Sebi has put a cap of 2.5% of AUM as fund expenses, expenses for ULIPs are capped at 4%, making it more attractive for banks to sell insurance products than mutual funds.",business,https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/getting-insurance-savvy-after-some-slippage-insurance-number-looking-better/1148489/

The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked 15 former and serving senior IDBI Bank officials and 24 others, including Aircel founder C. Sivasankaran, 11 companies and their directors for allegedly cheating the bank to the tune of ₹600 crore.

After registering the FIR on a reference from the Central Vigilance Commission, the agency conducted searches on the premises of the accused at 50 locations in Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Faridabad, Gandhinagar, Bengaluru, Belgaum, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Pune.

The CBI has alleged that the then senior bank officials and others committed fraud through loan accounts of Axcel Sunshine Limited, which has its office in British Virgin Islands, and the Finland-based Win Wind Oy.

Among the accused top bankers are M.S. Raghavan, the then CMD; Kishore Kharat, then CMD (currently CMD and CEO of Indian Bank); former deputy managing director (DMD) B.K. Batra; and then DMD M.O. Rego, who is now MD and CEO of Syndicate Bank, said the agency.

“Mr. Sivasankaran, a citizen of Seychelles, is not in India right now. He, being the chairman of Siva Group of companies, is also an accused in this case,” said a CBI official.

In October 2010, the bank sanctioned ₹322 crore in loans to Win Wind Oy, which later applied for bankruptcy in Finland in October 2013. The amount was declared a non-performing asset, said the CBI. In February 2014, the bank sanctioned another loan of ₹523 crore to Axcel Sunshine, an associate of the Siva Group.

“The funds were used to repay loans of other group companies, including Win Wind Oy,” said the official.

Seychelles-based Siva Investments and Holdings Limited is an entity of the Siva Group and Siva Investments is a holding company of Win Wind Oy, the CBI said.

According to the agency, then IDBI independent directors P.S. Shenoy, S. Ravi and Ninad Karpe; executive directors Vinay Kumar and B. Rabindra Nath; and G.M. Yadwadkar, the then executive director and current DMD, have also been arraigned along with Subroto Gupta, the then chief general manager and now an executive director, and others.",business,http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/idbi-bank-fraud-case-cbi-books-indian-bank-and-syndicate-bank-chiefs-aircel-founder/article23684141.ece
"As the CBI intensifies its investigation into the Rs 600-crore loan fraud case at IDBI Bank in which 15 serving and retired officials of the bank have been booked, fresh details have emerged. The case registered on Thursday against independent directors of IDBI Bank also includes S Ravi, the chairman of BSE.

Ravi, the chairman of IDBI Bank's Audit Committee, is also on the boards of several companies and organisations. He is an associate member of Association of Certified Fraud Examiners; a member of the takeover panel of Sebi. He is also a member on the boards of SBI-SG Global Securities Services, SMERA Ratings, STCI Finance, Star Union Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Tourism Finance Corporation of India and UTI Trustee Company, among others.

BSE declined to comment on the report.

The CBI has also named Aptech non-executive director Ninad Karpe in the case.

This is the second case in which the CBI has pinned the responsibility of bad loan on independent directors. Earlier, the agency had registered a case against Anil Razdan and two independent directors in Era Infrastructure Engineering loan default case.

Officials from SEBI and Ministry of Corporate Affairs say the post of independent director is merely a “rubber stamp”, despite having clearly defined roles. There is hardly any compliance with the rules, another source said. “Independent directors should be able to raise concerns over any wrongdoing in the system,” the source said.

“After the action on independent directors, professionals will be cautious about taking up the board seat as an independent director,” an independent director on the board of a bank told Moneycontrol

The CBI on Thursday registered case against former Aircel promoter C Sivasankaran's companies — British Virgin Islands-based M/s Axcel Sunshine Limited and Finland-based Win Wind Oy — for allegedly defaulting on loans worth Rs 600 crore taken from IDBI Bank.

The agency conducted searches at 50 places located across 10 cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Faridabad, Chennai, Bangalore, Belgaum, Hyderabad, Jaipur, and Pune. The search operation included raids in the residences of MS Raghvan (former CMD, IDBI Bank), BK Batra (former DMD of IDBI Bank) and Mervin O Rego (former DMD of IDBI Bank and presently serving as CMD and CEO of Syndicate Bank). As a result, 15 former and serving officers of the bank have been booked.

Later in the day, IDBI Bank issued a statement saying that they had given a loan to Axcel Sunshine Ltd in February 2014, which became a non performing asset in December 2015. The bank said the loan has been fully provided for and it had initiated steps to recover the dues in August 2016.

According to information received earlier, it was reported that IDBI Bank had sanctioned the loan in October 2016.",business,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/legal-trends/bankers-named-by-cbi-in-idbi-bank-loan-case-include-bse-chairman-s-ravi-2559317.html

Ravi, who took charge as Chairman of the Bombay Stock Exchange on November 14 last year, was serving as the independent director of IDBI Board during the period of fraud and was chairman of IDBI Bank’s Audit Committee.

Ironically, he is an associate member of Association of Certified Fraud Examiners — a member of the takeover panel of SEBI.

Ravi is also a member on the Boards of SBI-SG Global Securities Services, SMERA Ratings, STCI Finance, Star Union Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Company, Tourism Finance Corporation of India and UTI Trustee Company, among others.Another name that has figured in the fraud is of Shenoy, who was serving as an independent director of IDBI Board.

Incidentally, he was the former CMD of Bank of Baroda and was also elected as chairman of Indian Banks’ Association for 2004-05.

Aptech non-executive director Ninad Karpe has also figured in the fraud. Till date, IDBI Bank fraud has named 15 serving and retired officials of the bank, which includes two serving CMDs.“The rot is deeper than we anticipated.

See the names of people, they are serving CEOs and CMDs. The whole system needs to be overhauled. Also, independent directors cannot shrug off from their responsibilities,” a senior Finance Ministry official told TNIE.

"A recent study conducted by Adobe noted that Indian consumers are showing a preference for automation and non-human interactions with brands. The research, which was announced at Adobe Symposium 2018, outlined areas where businesses could improve to provide delightful customer experiences.

""Delivering great customer experiences is a competitive advantage. With rising internet and technology proliferation, customers have never been more empowered to voice their opinions when their brand experience is bad. The Experience Index 2018 reinforces the role of data and analytics in helping brands to truly understand their customers and work towards delivering incredible experiences across every touch point. At Adobe, we are partnering with Experience Makers across India to ensure they have the technology they need to deliver compelling experiences for customers,"" said Kulmeet Bawa, Managing Director, South Asia, Adobe.

The Experience Index 2018 reveals that consumer expectation scores in India barely cross 50 percent, indicating significant room for brands to improve customer experiences. Bringing down the positive impact of 'experience makers', the overall score is adversely affecting the strong negative impact of 'experience breakers', as consumers in India are fast to penalise brands that fail to execute successfully.

The study underlined interesting generational differences that surface across India. Customer service and lack of information from businesses are still some of the biggest pain-points of consumers. However, the study found that millennials are more likely to vocalise negative experiences with a brand than older consumers who may have given up on expecting anything more.

It was noted that in the 50 years age group, 94 percent respondents were extremely positive about technology's role in improving the quality of life. The Index also found that India's millennials are more interested in personalised services and fully automated interactions, owing to a greater appreciation for saving time.

Further, consumers in India are most impressed by new innovations that help them interact with a brand, and are open to businesses implementing new ways to automate such interactions.

""Lower than other age groups, only 45 percent of people over 50 indicated a preference for human interactions.

"Samsung may not be having a good time in the low-end and mid-range smartphone segments in India at the moment, especially with Chinese players like Xiaomi ruling the roost. But, when it comes to the premium smartphone segment, the world's largest smartphone maker is the undisputed king yet again. Riding on the unprecedented success of its flagship smartphones like Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8 and the recently-launched Galaxy S9 and S9+ in the country, Samsung has climbed to the top of the premium smartphone segment in India. In fact, the company has managed to grab the lion's share, capturing 50 percent of the market in the first quarter of 2018.

According to a report by Counterpoint Research, Samsung captured half of the premium smartphone segment in India, thereby showing an impressive 16 percent growth year-on-year (YoY).

The company surged past rivals like OnePlus and Apple, driven by demand for its latest flagships Galaxy S9, Galaxy S9+ along with the Galaxy Note 8 and the online-only Galaxy A8+.

China's OnePlus, which also has a decent fan following in India retained the second spot with a 25 percent market share and Apple occupied the third position with a 20 percent share, as per the Counterpoint Research report.

All three companies (Samsung, OnePlus, and Apple) combined contributed 95 percent of the total premium smartphone segment.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Samsung had slipped to the third spot with 17.6 percent share, while Apple led with a 46.9 percent share and OnePlus was second with 24.9 percent.

Samsung's return to form is an impressive 32.4 percent growth from the last quarter which ended December 2017.

The report attributes Samsung's feat to the Galaxy S9 series which were launched March 16 in India and came with a lot of promotional offers from online retailers as well as telecom operators like Reliance Jio and Airtel.

""(The) Galaxy S9 series promotions were strong in both offline and online channels with offers ranging from cashback, exchange, upgrade and data bundling plans across all major operators,"" said the report.

Meanwhile, Apple had a weak start to the year in India as demand for the ""overpriced"" iPhone X and iPhone * series declined, according to the report.



""Additionally, the Cupertino-based giant had to battle rising import tariffs due to lack of 'Make In India' domestic manufacturing capabilities for its portfolio,"" the report added.

Apple, which still doesn't have a full-fledged manufacturing unit in India was left with no choice but to increase the prices of its iPhones during the quarter due to the import tariffs which have increased thrice in the past five months.

The report further states that Apple's share in the premium segment plummeted as the volumes dipped by a mammoth 55 percent due to decline in the shipments of the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series.

Around the same time, the Indian government increased the import duty on CBUs (completely built Units) to 20 percent during Q1, 2018, leading to an increase in the prices of the already expensive iPhones.

But, while Samsung showed the biggest recovery and Apple, the biggest downfall, OnePlus was the fastest growing brand with over 192 percent YoY growth in the segment.

""OnePlus has been maintaining its second spot in the premium segment which it is has been holding since Q3 2017. OnePlus 5T was the best-selling model during the quarter, driven by its limited edition variant launch and expansion in the offline segment,"" Counterpoint said.

In terms of individual handsets, the OnePlus 5T was the biggest selling premium smartphone and has a 25 percent share of the premium model in the quarter, followed by Samsung Galaxy at No.2 with 17 percent share and the Galaxy S9 at 12 percent.

On the whole, the premium smartphone segment remained unchanged (YoY) but declined 13 percent compared to Q4 due to a drop in promotions post-Q4 2017.

"The market share of iPhone maker Apple plunged while Samsung dominated the premium smartphone segment in India in the first quarter of 2018, as per two market research reports released today.

“Apple’s share in the premium segment dipped as the volumes dipped by a massive 55 per cent due to decline in shipments for its iPhone 8 and X series.

Apple has been in discussions with the government to resolve some issues it has raised pertaining to manufacturing norms before it expands local production. In the meantime, three-times increase in import tariff during last five months is visible on sale of iPhones, it said.

According to CyberMedia Research, Apple was on top in the last quarter of 2017 with the launch of iPhone X and iPhone 8/8Plus, but the shipments of devices from the company to India declined by 74 per cent which was also reflected in market share.

“In the super premium (handsets priced above Rs 50,000 a unit) flagships segment, Apple saw its share decline from 82 to 25 per cent,” the report said “Samsung captured half of the premium segment with 16 per cent YoY growth, driven by strong initial demand of its new flagships S9, S9 Plus and online exclusive Galaxy A8 plus,” the report said.

Cashback, exchange, upgrade and bundled data schemes helped sales of Samsung S9 during the quarter.

“OnePlus was the fastest growing brand (with 192 per cent growth) in the segment capturing 25 per cent of the share,” the report said.

OnePlus has been holding the second spot in the premium segment since July-September 2017 period.

"OnePlus 6 has already become one of the most teased smartphones of the year - thanks to the tons of teasers that OnePlus publicly circulated so far. And now, the OnePlus 6 has been spotted in a live image that shows the front of the smartphone as well as the already confirmed notch design as well as a thin-bezel display. The latest development comes just after the company formally announced the OnePlus 6 launch date for the global as well as India and China regions. Also, the leaked image matches perfectly with the renders that surfaced in the recent past.

The image, courtesy iGyaan, is apparently a fresh one as it sports a date stamp of April 23. It doesn't detail the design of the OnePlus 6 due to the presence of a special case that is purposefully hiding the outer frame. Nevertheless, the leaked image shows the wallpaper of the OnePlus 6 alongside the instances of Android 8.1 Oreo that can be seen from the status bar, icons, and the on-screen buttons. The smartphone also sports the ""Never Settle"" company motto. Besides, you can see the notch that the company already confirmed formally. It will have a room for an earpiece and front-facing camera sensor and include an ambient light sensor and proximity sensor. The placement of the cut-outs don't give much indication as to where the hardware Alert slider has moved.

As per some of the latest revelations made officially, the OnePlus 6 will come with a glass back and is expected to feature a water-resistant build. The smartphone is also likely to include a Snapdragon 845 SoC, paired with 8GB of RAM, and feature up to 256GB of onboard storage. Additionally, there are speculations that the next-generation smartphone will have a 'Slide to Focus' option and a larger, 3450mAh battery. The company has also tied-up with Marvel Studios to launch a OnePlus 6 x Marvel Avengers Limited Edition in India.

"While a number of leaks have already revealed the design of the upcoming OnePlus 6, there’s always room for another one until the official launch takes place on 16 May in London.

A new leaked image courtesy Techtastic, has revealed another live image of the upcoming flagship from OnePlus. This time however, the device is buried in a white embargo case, with only the display being completely visible, with the notch proudly showing up top.

The white case is meant to hide the device from prying eyes and so far it seems to have done a good job, revealing nothing apart from the display and the notches at the side for access to the various buttons and slots.

What we can tell is that the smartphone inside is not an early pre-production prototype, but a more recent iteration or a production model. The date on the Windows task bar displayed on the monitor, confirms that image was clicked at around 6:03 PM on April 23, 2018.

Now that we know we are looking at an almost production ready model, let’s start with what’s obvious and right in front of us, the display.

There’s the usual notch at the top and even though the case does a good job of concealing the body of the smartphone, it’s easy to point out how the bezel at the top is far thinner than the one at the bottom, indicating that the OnePlus 6 like its siblings the Vivo V9 and the Oppo F7 will come with a chin at the bottom of the display. Still then, going by past leaks that chin is expected to be a lot thinner as compared to the chin we have seen on the V9 and F7.

Next up is the standard wallpaper from OnePlus that has been the default since the OnePlus 5T. Also visible is the incorrect date, (possibly because it contains no SIM card) or has not been hooked on to a cellular or Wi-Fi network for benchmarking.

Looking at the lower part of the display, there’s the absence of the translucent app drawer with just the up arrow indicator, hinting that the device could be running Android 8.1 Oreo.

Moving to the access ports of the case, the left side features the expected SIM card tray at the top, with a large cavity for the volume button below it. On the right side of the display we expect the Alert Slider to be placed at the top notch with the power button below it.

As per previously leaked images and rumours, the OnePlus 6 is expected to arrive with a 3D curved glass back, and possibly pack in wireless charging as well, since they are expected to take the premium smartphone route this year.

As for the core hardware, expect a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC inside paired with 8 GB RAM and up to 256 GB of internal storage on the top of the line models. The device is also expected to feature a dual camera setup at the back and a 3,450 mAh battery.

Lastly, fans in India can also expect a special Marvel Avengers: Infinity War edition of the OnePlus 6, similar to the Star Wars edition model which was launched last year.

The OnePlus 6 is set to arrive in India on 17 May with sales starting from 21 May.",tech,https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/oneplus-6-showcased-in-live-photo-with-notched-display-hints-at-revamped-button-layout-4448373.html

Apple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days (and you can read my weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes).

Details On The Disappointing iPhone SE 2

Apple is expected to announce an update of the iPhone SE for a launch during Q2, but those hoping for a significant step up in hardware are going to be disappointed. The upcoming SE2 looks set to be little more than the iPhone SE with one upgrade and one removal. Forbes’ Gordon Kelly looks at the details:

Speaking to “many iPhone casemakers” at the massive Global Sources Mobile Electronics 2018 show in Hong Kong, Macotakara reports there is a wide consensus based on their supply chain sources that the iPhone SE2 will simply be an iPhone SE with an A10 Fusion chip from the iPhone 7 and… yes, the 3.5mm headphone jack removed. In fact, Macotakara even says existing iPhone SE cases are expected to fit the iPhone SE2 as it will have “the same main body size” (and therefore a 4-inch 750p display). Apple Pay with NFC will be included as will Touch ID but all Apple’s more recent iPhone additions will be missing, including Face ID, OLED, dual cameras and even 3D Touch which was introduced with the iPhone 6S in 2015.

iPhone 8 and 8 Plus Overtake iPhone X

2017 saw the hope of a super-cycle of iPhone sales in 2018 reversing the falling unit sales and market share of iOS-powered smartphones. That hope has not materialised, and as more sales and analyse of the 2018 Q1 sales are published, the iPhone X is looking less of a home run and is barely reaching first base:

The iPhone X may be the best-selling iPhone in Apple’s current line-up, but when the competition is the tired and iterative iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, it’s not much of a challenge. Unfortunately the combined sales of the iPhone 8 family are outpacing the sales of the iPhone X. Break down the figures from CIRP’s research published today and Apple may struggle to keep the ‘iPhone X is the best-selling iPhone’ discussion point in play… US sales in Q1 of the iPhone 8 made up 23 percent of total iPhone sales, the iPhone 8 Plus made up 21 percent, and the iPhone X stumbled to third place with 16 percent. That wasn’t the plan.

Details on the numbers here.

Siri Not Connecting To The Faithful

Tech.pinions survey of early adopters of the iPhone X has perhaps unsurprisingly discovered that most owners are very satisfied with their iOS powered smartphone. But lurking in the results is a canary in the digital coal mine. Siri is not working with the in-crowd, as I reported earlier this week:

Only one feature is rated below sixty percent. Siri scores an out of favour twenty percent in terms of satisfaction. While Bajarin highlights that the early adopters can be a very critical bunch (just as they can be very positive) the fact that Siri is rated so low is not a good sign for Apple. The next battlefield in consumer electronics is voice control. Google and Amazon have invested heavily in this technology and are seen as leaders of the pack. Siri is struggling to catch up, and the standalone HomePod speaker is not flying off the shelves.

"The narrative is growing that demand for the $1,000 iPhone X has stalled in the first part of 2018. It’s further bolstered by new information from a supply chain source with direct knowledge of Apple’s plans saying the company has ordered the production of only 8 million iPhone X units in calendar Q2 of 2018.

This source says Apple ordered the production of too many units of the iPhone X in the last calendar quarter of 2017, and is now trying to “burn off” the inventory that has piled up at its resellers.

Apple sold 77.3 million total iPhones during the 2017 holiday quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook said the X outsold all other iPhone models every week of the first quarter after the device’s launch on November 3, 2017, launch. And a high average sale price of $796 across all iPhone models suggested that the X, Apple’s most expensive phone, was indeed a heavy seller. Above Avalon analyst Neil Cybart says that the X contributed about 35% of total phone sales during the holiday quarter, which works out to about 27 million phones.

But as the global smartphone market has ceased to grow, and as smartphone owners hold on to their current devices longer, consumers may be less apt to part with more than a grand for a phone.

Our source says Apple is disappointed with sales of the iPhone X, and doubts have grown within the company that releasing a $1,000-plus smartphone in the current global smartphone market was a winning idea.

Supplier Slowdown

The new Q2 production data point comes on the heels of Samsung’s quarterly earnings, in which the company reported soft demand for its OLED displays. Samsung makes the OLED display used in the iPhone X. The South Korean company said it expects this slow demand to continue through the second calendar quarter. The softness isn’t entirely attributable to Apple; Samsung uses its OLED displays in its own smartphones, sales of which were impacted by competition in the high-end phone market, the company said.

Earlier this week the iPhone X supplier TSMC warned investors about slow demand for its smartphone chips. Analysts had been expecting $8.8 billion in revenues from the chip maker, but Taiwan-based TSMC dropped its second quarter guidance to between $7.8 billion and $7.9 billion.",tech,https://www.fastcompany.com/40564691/source-apple-will-produce-only-8-million-iphone-x-units-in-q2
"I use my 9.7-inch iPad Pro a lot, so when Apple introduced its entry-level 2018 iPad with Apple Pencil support, I knew I had to try it out. I’ve been using the new model this month, and I wanted to share the biggest thing I’ve noticed about it, which is:

Nothing

“Nothing, Jonny, really?”

You heard me right. I have been using the 2018 iPad to do everything I usually use the Pro for: taking notes, writing stories, working on images, sketching, communications, research, watching movies, listening to Apple Music, even playing my favorite game (which is still Rome: Total War, for some reason).

I’ve noticed nothing.

[ Further reading: 10+ iOS 11 iPad Pro productivity tips ]

No performance compromises, no in-app stutter, no lag, for the most part almost everything feels almost exactly the same.

That’s not surprising when you think about the powerful A10 Fusion chip (as used in iPhone 7) inside the 2018 iPad, which is actually faster than the A9X chip inside the 2016 Pro, according to Geekbench. (Apple claims it to be 50 percent faster than last year’s iPad.) The new model is also equipped with 2GB RAM, just like the 2016 Pro, though the current top of the range boasts more.

While you won’t be able to use background apps if you open a third app in Slide Over while working with two other apps in Split View, you can still happily use other iOS 11 Multitasking tools.

Battery life? Given Apple’s persistent record in under promising and over delivering, don’t be surprised if you get more than the advertised 10 hours in normal use.

Pencil 'Pad writer

If you like to write (or sketch), you’ll also need to get an $89 Apple Pencil, which works with this iPad.

I’m not especially artistic, but I do like sketching, and I find little difference working on either the 2016 Pro or 2018 iPad. Pressure and tilt sensitivity are just as good. I do note that the experience feels slightly different due, I think, to the lack of reflective coating on the entry-level device.

Feeling isn’t everything: The display refresh rate is a little slower (60Hz v. 120Hz on the Pro). This can make for a little lag when you draw – most people writing or sketching on the tablet (like me) won’t notice this at all, though some pro artists might. If you need the best available art tablet, you might want a Pro. But for everyone else, Apple’s new tablet really does the job here.

Let’s get physical

On first glance, the 2018 iPad keeps to tradition; it looks like last year’s iPad, which looked like 2013’s iPad Air. With larger bezels around the side, the tablet is thicker (7.5mm) than the current Pro (6.1mm). And where iPad Pros have four speakers, the new iPad has just two.

A word about the 9.7-inch display: The iPad boasts fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, but only Apple’s Pro range is fully laminated with an anti-reflective coating. That means you can see the gap between the display and the glass above it on the new iPad, which you won’t see on a Pro.

Anecdotally, I find the lack of lamination means it feels much more like I’m poking a sheet of glass when I work with the 2018 model. The Pro seems a little ""gentler"" to touch.

You also get Apple Pay, Touch ID, iOS 11, and most everything else, including a headphone jack, though when you look you'll find no Smart Connector. Given that I think the only useful Smart Connector accessories are Apple’s rather cramped Smart Keyboard or the Logitech Create, I can’t summon up much concern about that. Use some cheap Bluetooth keyboard, and get over it. Is that harsh? Perhaps, but it’s just not that big a deal to me.

A camera compromise

For me, camera quality is the biggest compromise in the tablet. The 2018 iPad offers an 8-megapixel camera in contrast to the 12-megapixels inside older and current iPad Pros. There’s no optical image stabilization and no flash.

I guess Apple did this to shave a few dollars off the cost. And while it competes well with those second-rate, camera-free Chromebooks (that cost the same and are useless if you’re not online), I do think it could have pushed its video creativity in education message much harder with a higher quality camera inside.

Of course, it’s not just the megapixels that do the capture; it’s the quality of the software used to process and edit the image, and that’s where Apple’s years of advances in imaging really show.

You may not be capturing as many pixels as you do on an iPhone, but the images are still good enough – just more liable to camera shake given its 1-pound weight. Don't forget, so long as you can get high-quality assets from other sources into iCloud, you can then edit it on the tablet using iMovie software Apple provides for free. It certainly provides a camera that’s good enough “for the rest of us.” (I think a lot of people use their phone to capture images/video and then edit on iPad.)

Storage and video quality

I’ve been able to create video seamlessly without dropped frames, stutter, or other errors. I was surprised at this at first, but it’s pretty clear to me that the 2018 iPad is a peer player in comparison to the 2016 iPad Pro. The processor comes into its own on such tasks.

I do note that if you want to do something more serious with the movies, the iPad Pro models both support 4K HD, while the 2018 iPad will “only” handle 1,080p HD.

Apple’s aiming this iPad at schools, and for school video projects, the capacity to capture and edit 1,080p HD at this kind of price is still a beautiful thing.

On the same tip, storage on the new model maxes out at 128GB ($429), while the current Pro range boasts a maximum 512GB ($999 for 10.5-inch model, $1,149 for the 12.9-inch).

If you want your iPad to be capable of making 4K HD video, you’ll need the storage space – but you may feel that the extra c.$600 it will cost you might be better spent on a second-hand Mac for editing tasks, giving you a little of both worlds. You can also get hold of relatively inexpensive external storage dongles to offload archive material if you are working on a movie using a 2018 iPad in the field.

Buying advice

I’ve mainly been focused on comparing the new $329 entry-level iPad with the 2016 iPad in this review. I think it’s a valid comparison. I think it shows how focused the company is on bringing its most sophisticated technologies to a much wider market.

If the fast, powerful 2016 iPad Pro was the tablet equivalent of a Koenigsegg, the 2018 iPad is a similar car with a faster engine at half the price. It even offers better performance specs than most of the non-Apple tablet competition at any price.

The entry-level iPad seals Apple’s position at the head of the tablet game, and if you want a good value-for-money tablet that’s still one of the best money can buy, this is hard to beat. The current iPad Pro range, of course, remains king of this road.

"Instagram’s updated Terms and Data Policy: Here are the details to keep in mind. Instagram’s updated Terms and Data Policy: Here are the details to keep in mind.

With European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) coming into effect from May 25, popular apps and social media companies are busy upgrading their data policy and terms of service. Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Instagram have announced changes to their privacy and data policy. WhatsApp, which is the world’s most popular messaging app, has already announced that it will let users download all the data they have given to the app.

Instagram, the popular photo-sharing network owned by Facebook, has also revised its terms and data policy usage. So what does it mean for the Instagram user and what has changed from the terms of service back from 2013? Here’s a detailed look.

If you are an avid Instagram user, you must have already got a message from the company announcing an update to its terms and data policy. Users will have to accept the new terms in order to continue using Instagram. One thing to keep in mind is that users still own all the photos and and videos, they share on the network. However, going forward the apps terms will “reflect that Facebook Inc is responsible for Instagram.”

The app now has a new “Data Policy” which will explain how the data shared by the user is collected and used in Facebook Products. The policy also covers the newer features such as stories, direct messaging, activity status and the creative tools in the camera app. In the terms of service, Instagram now says that users need to “be at least 13 years old or the minimum legal age in your country to use Instagram.” Earlier the terms of service just said a user had to be 13 years old to use the service. The conditions also note, “You (user) must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.”

Filters, masks used are also part of the Instagram data policy. Filters, masks used are also part of the Instagram data policy.

“We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies,” add the new terms of service. Also Instagram will not let anyone who is a “convicted sex offender,” use the app anymore. These were not mentioned in the previous terms of service from 2013.

The new policy mentions the data sharing with Facebook in detail, which it adds will be used to personalise experience across products, including ads experiences. On advertisers, the policy says, “We provide ads without telling advertisers who you are. The policy has more information about what we do share with advertisers and partners. We never sell your data.” This too was not present in the previous terms of service.

What does Instagram’s new data policy say

Instagram says, “We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.” The data collected by Instagram includes the content a user provides as well as metadata, such as the location of a photo or the date a file was created.

The new data policy from Instagram will include information about facial recognition, though the app is not using this technology yet. Instagram says, “If we introduce it, we’ll let you know and give you a choice.” Facebook is however, using such technology though users have the option of signing out of it from the social network. It adds, “the face-recognition templates we create may constitute data with special protections under the laws of your country.”

Instagram’s new data policy also covers new features like Stories, etc. Instagram’s new data policy also covers new features like Stories, etc.

The data collected includes what a user sees when they use features like the camera, masks or filters, including the ones they prefer more. It goes on to add, “Our systems automatically process content and communications you and others provide to analyze context and what’s in them.”

Instagram also collects “information about the people, pages, accounts, hashtags and groups” a user is connected with, including those a user communicates with the most on the service. The app also collects time, frequency and duration of activities and how features like the camera are used. Purchases made via the app are also collected as part of the Instagram data policy, which will include payment information, such as credit or debit card number and other card information, etc.

So is Instagram collecting your Contacts?

Yes, but only if a user chooses to upload it to the service, according to the terms and services. The data policy notes, “We also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know and for the other purposes listed below.”

What other data is Instagram collecting?

The photo-sharing app also collects information that others provide about you on the network, when they are using the product. This includes a comment on a photo of the user, messages, when contacts are synced, etc. Finally the app is collecting device information which includes the computer, phone, connected TV used when accessing Instagram and its products. Information such as the operating system, hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app and file names and types, and plugins are also collected, says the data policy.

Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device, including cookie IDs and settings.

However, there is some data that comes with special protections, which includes religious views, political views, who a user is interested in, the health of a user, racial or ethnic origin. The policy says such information “could be subject to special protections under the laws” of the relevant country. Instagram is also collecting data from non-Facebook users or those who are logged out. The policy notes that in this case advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send the company information through Facebook Business Tools, which includes the Facebook Login.

So how is Instagram using all of this information?

One is to help improve the company’s products and this includes the News Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads.

Second, the information is used to make suggestions for the user, on who they might want to follow, groups to follow, etc. Also the information from Instagram is shared across Facebook products and devices.

The data policy notes, “We connect information about your activities on different Facebook Products and devices to provide a more tailored and consistent experience on all Facebook Products you use, wherever you use them. For example, we can suggest that you join a group on Facebook that includes people you follow on Instagram or communicate with using Messenger.” Of course this information is also used to create personalised ads.

"Over 3 million people are actively using WhatsApp Business app, says Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

He said this during the social media giant's Q1 2018 earnings call, the VentureBeat reported late on Wednesday.

WhatsApp Business, a standalone app separate from the other version of WhatsApp used by 1.5 billion people, was launched in January for Android users in six countries including India, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Britain and the US.

WhatsApp Business competes with services like Apple's Business Chat and RCS messaging for Android and Facebook's own Messenger Platform, chat apps all built around connecting businesses with customers.

While WhatsApp Business is still being rolled out, conversational commerce through things like payments on Messenger will also be important to the social media giant, the report said.

""Over the next five years we're focused on building out the business ecosystems around our apps like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger,"" Zuckerberg said.

""I think what you're going to start to see are people interacting with Pages that you follow, Pages on Facebook or Instagram.

""You see content from that Page, and you can click through to a message thread, and then you can either get customer support or complete a transaction or do a follow-on transaction, and that will be very valuable for businesses so we view the payment in that context, not as the goal but as something that's helping the business and the person succeed at having a transaction or doing what they're trying to do,"" Zuckerberg noted.

WhatsApp Business, available on Google Play Store, makes it easier for companies to connect with customers, and more convenient for its users to chat with businesses that matter to them.

"HMD Global has been teasing the return of Nokia X over a week now, and the company is rumored to launch the Nokia X6 in China today. The Nokia X was the first Nokia smartphone to run on forked Android OS, back when the Finnish giant was acquired by Microsoft, and Lumia devices ran Windows Phone 7 OS, and above. The current Nokia X6 will be exactly when die-hard Nokia fans needed back then. While we have already come across rumored specifications, the newly leaked photos show off the design in full glory.

As we can see in the leaked photos (via GizmoChina), the front panel features an edge-to-edge display, something that has now become common with smartphones. And after the iPhone X, the display ‘notch’ has gained popularity, and the Nokia X6 has also embraced it. The notch houses the earpiece, front camera and proximity sensors.

The back is made from glass and has the vertical dual camera setup placed at the center, and a circular fingerprint sensor below it. The volume rocker and the power button is placed on the right, whereas the charging port is at the bottom, but it is not clear if it is a microUSB or USB Type-C port.

Nokia X6 expected prices

As per the Digi TechQQ report, the smartphone will be offered in two storage variants – with 4GB RAM expected to be priced at RMB 1,599, which is roughly Rs 16,800. The 6GB RAM variant, on the other hand, will likely set you back by RMB 1,799 – roughly Rs 19,000.

Nokia X6 expected specifications, features

An earlier report hints at a 5.8-inch Full HD+ display, running at a resolution of 1080x2280pixels, and an aspect ratio of 19:9.

"In just three days HMD Global will take the wraps off a new X-series device in China. Earlier today we found out this would be called Nokia X6, a name previously worn by a Symbian-powered device back in 2009.

Now the first official-looking press renders of the new Nokia X6 have been outed in China, and by looking at them you have certainly noticed that it is wearing a dreaded notch on the front. There's still a 'chin' too, although it is rather small - at least compared to what other Android OEMs have done.

The Nokia logo on the front usually sits in the right part of the top screen bezel, but had to be moved to the chin this time around, as there really isn't a bezel where it used to be.

On the back, the X6 resembles the recently unveiled Nokia 7 plus, with its copper accents and dual rear camera placement. The only notable difference between the two is that the X6 has its LED flash array in between the cameras and the fingerprint scanner, whereas it's to the right of the camera island in the 7 plus.

Nokia's first notched touchscreen will be 5.8"" in size and have 19:9 aspect ratio. The entry-level model will be powered by the MediaTek Helio P60 chipset, paired with 4GB of RAM, while a slightly more expensive iteration will swap those out for a Snapdragon 636 and 6GB of memory.

The Nokia X6 will run Android Oreo from day one, and will start in China at around $250/210.

"HMD Global is largely expected to launch a new smartphone today in China

HMD Global recently expanded its portfolio with the launch of new variants of last year’s smartphones – Nokia 6 (2018), Nokia 7 Plus, Nokia 8 Sirocco, and Nokia 8110 4G, alongside introducing a new model Nokia 1. Two of these phones have been revived by the company in a new body while maintaining the same nostalgia. The Finnish company is now planning to bring back another iconic Nokia smartphone to life.

On the occasion of the 13th anniversary of the launch of Nokia N series smartphones, HMD Global reportedly shared a post on Chinese social media website Weibo, hinting at resurrecting the N series. The Weibo post, first spotted by AndroidHeadlines, suggests that a new Nokia N model could launch on May 2 at an event in Beijing, China.

The post contains an image of the Nokia N9 smartphone, which was quite popular back in time. The smartphone was launched in 2011 running MeeGo 1.2 Harmattan OS. However, since all of these platforms are now dead, HMD Global could launch the new Nokia N version with stock Android, much like the other Nokia branded phones it has launched so far.

The translated version of the post from Chinese reads – “On April 27th, 2005, the Nokia N series unveiled, and possessing a hand is enough to bring aura. On this day after 13 years, in Sanlitun, guess what will happen to Xiaonuo? From April 27 to May 2, in Sanlitun, wait for you to see the “box.” Come, come, come.” While it is unclear whether these dates are just for an event organised to celebrate the launch of the Nokia N series, the company may make an announcement on what it plans to do with the Nokia N series. The information on the new model’s specifications, features, and look is scarce as of now.

Meanwhile, HMD Global is largely expected to launch a new smartphone today in China. It is speculated that the company may take the wraps off the Nokia X6, which has been in the rumour mill for a while. The Nokia X6 is reported to come with a design similar to the recently-launched Nokia 7 Plus. Besides, the Nokia X6 could come with a 5.8-inch full-HD+ display with 19:9 aspect ratio. While it’s common nowadays to have an 18:9 aspect ratio, the 19:9 ratio is usually found on the smartphone with a notched display – however, none of the reports has suggested so.

The Nokia X6 is also rumoured to come with two different processors – octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 and octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor. The RAM and storage options on the smartphone are likely to be the combinations of 4GB/ 64GB and 6GB/ 128GB. While the former is said to come with a price tag of 1,599 yuan (roughly Rs 16,800), the latter could be priced at 1,799 yuan (approximately Rs 19,000). For the cameras, the smartphone is said to have a dual camera setup with at least a 12-megapixel shooter, powered by Zeiss optics.",tech,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/iconic-nokia-n9-to-be-revived-in-new-avatar-heres-what-hmd-global-said/1147995/

This is what the Nokia 8 Sirocco is all about. The phone has been designed and crafted with great deal of attention and you can tell that from the moment you take it out of the box. The first thing the strikes you is its 3D curved display on top. The Gorilla Glass curves smoothly around the right and left sides and meets the stainless steel edges. The other thing you notice is just how compact the phone is and it's quite interesting how the company managed to do that. At 7.5mm in thickness, the phone is pretty slim. But HMD did make some sacrifices to achieve that such as ditching the 3.5mm headphones jack. Additionally, the power button and volume controls on the side are so closely aligned to the frame that it makes it hard to find them out without looking.

With around 95 per cent of the phone made up of glass, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is a looker and there's no doubt about that. But some hands-on time with the phone can be a little unflattering. The wide display and sharp edges makes the phone a little uncomfortable to use. The glass back will also attract fingerprints and smudges. And because it's mostly all glass, you will want to slap on a cover (provided in the box) if you're a little clumsy. However, having a cover on does take out some of the charm of the phone so that's a decision you're going to have to make. The phone's compact design makes it easy to carry around and slide into your pocket, but despite its form factor, it's not the easiest to use with one hand. Overall, I feel the phone looks fantastic if you admire it from a distance, but it is a little inconvenient to actually use it.

Display

One of the things that really makes the phone look gorgeous is how the pOLED panel curves around the edges like you see on the Galaxy S9. Unlike the Galaxy S9, however, the curved edges on the 8 Sirocco aren't functional and they are really there just for aesthetic purposes. Thanks to the slim bezels on the top and bottom, one will easily be fooled into thinking this is an 18:9 display, much like the industry trend. However, the phone actually sports a typical 16:9 display all the while giving you a full-screen feel.

The Nokia 8 Sirocco's 5.5-inch Quad HD pOLED display looks vivid and sharp. Colours on screen pop and look punchy, although they do look oversaturated as well. The curved display gives it a very 3D feel to it and watching videos on the phone look even better as it looks like it's flowing down from one side to the other. What I find really great is that HMD has managed to give a full-screen display with a 16:9 aspect ratio, so what you get is the experience of an 18:9 display and the fact that you won't have to stretch and crop anything since every video streaming app like YouTube and Netflix already support the standard 16:9 aspect ratio.

That being said, the curved display does cause vertical blue bands to appear on either sides, which is noticeable especially on a white background. Secondly, the brightness levels aren't the best and this is something I found to be true even with the Nokia 7 Plus and Nokia 6 (2018). Under bright sunlight, visibility can be poor even at maximum brightness, which also tends to drain the battery quite a bit.

Software and performance

HMD announced that all its phones from Nokia 3 and upwards will now be part of the Android One program. And like the Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 7 Plus, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is an Android One phone, which means pure, stock Android software running the latest Oreo version out-of-the-box. During the review period, the phone received the April security update. Android One also guarantees timely security updates for at least two years as well as Android P and Android Q in the future. This when combined with last year's flagship Snapdragon 835 processor and 6GB of RAM means absolutely smooth, fluid and fast performance.

Yes, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is powered by the Snapdragon 835 and not the 845 as most flagships are expected to this year. But before you get disappointed let me tell you that the Snapdragon 835 is a fantastic chipset and when you combine that with stock Android, the results are just great. During my time with the phone I found no lag or stutter and it ran buttery smooth consistently. So as far as performance and software is concerned, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is a winner in my books.

The latest Nokia phones did come with Face Unlock, but the Android 8.1 Oreo update seemed to have removed that. HMD may bring it back after perhaps improving it, but nothing is known as of now. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, but it's not the fastest out there. The single speaker grille on the bottom won't be loud, but it is clear and the sound quality is crisp. The Nokia 8 Sirocco also comes with a Glance Screen feature that is essentially an Always-On display which shows the time, date, battery percentage and notifications on screen without having to turn it on.

Camera

Much like the Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 8 Plus, the Nokia 8 Sirocco comes with Zeiss-branded optics. On the rear, the phone sports a dual camera setup which includes a 12-megapixel primary sensor with f/1.7 aperture and a 13-megapixel secondary telephoto sensor. Both the cameras lack OIS but there is EIS which helps in stabilizing videos. The rear camera setup on the Nokia 8 Sirocco is slightly better than the Nokia 7 Plus. A big reason for why the photos look colourful and bright is also because of the vibrant OLED display.

But the cameras face a similar issue in that photos captured aren't the best detailed. Under bright light outdoors, the camera captures bright, slightly oversaturated pictures. Colours look punchy and deep so you won't have to worry about them looking dull. The shutter speed is quite fast so you won't get a lot of shaky photos, which is great. Once again, like the Nokia 7 Plus, low-light shots aren't the best as they often come out noisy and lack detail. Camera features include a Live Bokeh and a Pro Mode. Live Bokeh was a bit difficult to get around because it does not indicate if the subject is too close or too far as it did on the Nokia 7 Plus. Pro Mode is a neat little feature that lets you manually tweak the ISO, White Balance, shutter speed and exposure to your liking.

But the 5-megapixel front camera does sound disappointing considering the price you pay. Predictably, it doesn't offer anything spectacular. Selfies look decent outdoors under good lighting, but they get soft and noisy in low-light.

Battery

When I reviewed the Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 7 Plus, I was largely impressed with the battery life on both the phones. The Nokia 8 Sirocco houses a 3,260mAh battery, which once again doesn't disappoint. The phone with its qHD display will drain the battery a bit faster than you're typical full-HD display, so you won't get a terrific battery life like say the Nokia 7 Plus. But the 8 Sirocco still impresses, managing to deliver a good day full of battery.

Thanks to quick charge support, you can juice up the phone from zero to 100 per cent in about one and a half to two hours in the morning just before leaving for work and the phone should take you all the way to the night and then some on average to above average usage. This includes messaging, browsing social media apps and streaming some videos on-the-go. While the Nokia 7 Plus would give about 6 hours of screen on time, the 8 Sirocco gave me around 4 hours of screen on time on an average. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging.

Should you buy the Nokia 8 Sirocco

The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a beautifully crafted device and HMD has paid a lot of attention to the details to prove that it is capable of deliver really good-looking flagship devices. So from afar, I could just stare at the phone for hours and not get bored. But on a closer look, I realised that the phone isn't the most convenient for most users and may not be for everyone. It's one for die-hard Nokia fans who want the best-looking Android device from the company right now.

However, the 8 Sirocco isn't the company's 2018 flagship phone per se. That will likely be the Nokia 9 or something along those lines later this year. For now, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is the company's best premium smartphone and it does impress in terms of design and performance and is capable enough to take on the likes of the Galaxy S9 and Pixel 2, barring the cameras of course. The phone does miss out on a few key details like offering dual-SIM support (a very important aspect especially in India). If you're paying around 50k, one does expect dual-SIM slots and a 3.5mm headphone jack, among other things. Additionally, as good as the phone is to look at, its sharp edges and wide body make it uncomfortable to hold.

Ultimately, the Nokia 8 Sirocco is for those who are after the looks and want a compact phone that looks and feels absolutely premium. If having terrific cameras isn't important, the phone nails pretty much everything else. Some minor ifs and buts do exist but no phone is perfect. If you have the means to spend around 50k, then the 8 Sirocco should definitely be on your list.",tech,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/reviews/story/nokia-8-sirocco-review-1221298-2018-04-27
"Tata has boosted the appeal of its stylish Nexon by adding an automatic transmission option for both petrol and diesel versions. Unlike the segment leader, the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, which has no automatic option at all, or the Ford EcoSport, which has an auto option only for the petrol variant, the Nexon is the first model in the compact SUV segment to offer an automatic for both petrol and diesel options in a bid to attract a wider set of customers. But unlike the EcoSport, which switched from a sophisticated twin-clutch auto to the more mainstream torque converter with the facelift, the Nexon gets the more basic automated manual transmission (AMT) that piggybacks on the six-speed manual gearbox (for the petrol and diesel).

There’s also a new colour option - the Etna Orange body colour with a Sonic Silver roof makes the Nexon stand out from the crowd but is available only in the top-end XZA+ variant. There are no changes on the inside, and the cabin continues to offer a premium ambience.

The Tata Nexon also has a new colour option - the Etna Orange body colour with a Sonic Silver roof. Available only in the top-end XZA+ variant, the colour makes the car stand out in the crowd.

The Nexon AMT variant gets the same Multi-Drive modes (Eco, City and Sport) from the manual variant and also a creep function, which is a boon in bumper-to-bumper traffic. We drove the diesel-AMT first, and the four-cylinder engine with 110hp and 260Nm of torque complements the six-speed AMT unit quite well. The diesel-AMT is smooth right from the moment you take off from standstill, and the consequent shifts are no different. With low to medium throttle inputs, the AMT behaves very similar to a conventional torque converter gearbox. The car stays in the power band and there is always enough power available on tap. On hard acceleration, the typical ‘head nod’ or pause between shifts is present, but not to uncomfortable levels. The AMT unit is quick to drop down a gear (even two if needed) when you suddenly floor the accelerator and even shifts up when you ease on the throttle for a smoother transition.

The diesel-AMT is smooth right from the moment you take off from standstill, and the consequent shifts are no different.

Engage the Eco mode and you will see the shifts happening earlier and the transition between gears becoming much smoother as compared to the City mode. The Sport mode is what most drivers will prefer when in a hurry as the gearbox holds on to a gear much longer than in other modes. Move the gear lever to the left, to manual mode, and you can take control of shifting but this doesn’t make gear shifting any quicker. There’s a slight delay in upshifts as well as downshifts when in manual mode and we found it best to leave the mode in Sport for spirited driving.

The AMT variants of the Tata Nexon has a hill-hold assist which eliminates the use of handbrake on inclines.

The three-cylinder turbo-petrol engine develops the same 110hp and 170Nm of torque, but the implementation of the AMT is not as good as in the diesel. The on-off throttle transition is a bit jerky and power delivery isn’t very linear, though some of the flat spots have been ironed out. On part throttle, or when driving with a gentle foot, the gear shifts on the petrol-AMT are quite smooth, which makes it a nice city car. The difference in between the petrol-AMT and the diesel-AMT is quite drastic and you need to be more careful with the throttle input. The progressive shifts are well concealed with part-throttle input, which makes it quite nice to move around in the city. In overall terms, the shifts in the diesel-AMT are smoother and more progressive than in the petrol-AMT, which hesitates when asked to shift quickly.

The Tata Nexon is the ideal city car for someone who commutes long distances on bad city roads.

Differences between the three drive modes is quite substantial for both petrol and diesel variants, and they suit the different conditions they were designed for. As a result, we were switching between Eco, City and Sport modes constantly. Hill-hold assist is a welcome feature on the AMT variants and it eliminates the use of handbrake on inclines. This is the ideal city car for someone who commutes long distances on bad city roads.

The prices of the Nexon auto variants will be announced only at the time of the launch which is due in the first-half of May 2018. We expect Tata Motors to price it competitively, with prices likely to be around Rs 9.6-10.5 lakh or Rs 60,000 more than the equivalent manual variant.

"Tata Nexon is the official partner of the ongoing Indian Premier League and a few days back the manufacturer revealed the Mumbai Indian edition of the car. The special edition Nexon got a lot of decals to show the support to the team. Here is a new IPL edition Nexon that has been dressed to support the Sunrisers Hyderabad but it is not an official edition.

What are the changes?

The changes are inspired by the logo of Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Nexon gets decals of wings on the side of the car which is inspired by the Falcon logo of the team. The car also gets matte metallic red colour wrap on the roof and the humanity line that wraps around the SUV. It also gets the red wrap on the rear bumper. The same wrap can be seen on the front bumper and fog lamp housings. The Nexon is available in dual tone colour as stock but is not available with the red roof and this design looks quite interesting. Even the alloy wheel fins get the red metallic highlight.

The car also gets an illuminated front logo and a new chrome skeleton that wraps around the front grille and the fog lamp housings. It is based on the top end XZ+ variant and no changes have been done to the interiors or the engine.

While it is unclear if Tata will officially offer their IPL edition cars in the market, interested people can always get their vehicles wrapped like this. Wrapping does not need any changes on the registration certificate of the vehicle and it stays valid with the stock specifications. Painting the vehicle, on the other hand, needs changes done to the registration certificate.

Tata Nexon has become quite popular in the Indian market and gets a 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol and a 1.5-litre turbocharged diesel engine option. Both the engine options produce a maximum of 108 Bhp but the petrol engine churns out a maximum of 170 Nm torque while the diesel engine produces a maximum of 260 Nm. Both get a manual 6-speed transmission. Soon, Tata will offer an AMT version with both the engine options.

"Apple's ambitious plans of releasing three variants in its 2018 iPhone lineup are reportedly getting updated as the launch date nears. As per previous rumours, Apple is set to unveil two new models with OLED displays, and a cheaper one with an LCD panel at its iPhone event later this year. A new report, with information sourced from the trusted KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, suggests that the lower-end LCD iPhone will sport a stronger display glass with the CGS (Cover Glass Sensor) technology.

A report by Chinese publication Feng on Wednesday reveals says the new CGS display - while making the smartphone more impact resistant and lighter overall - won't support 3D Touch. The lack of 3D Touch on the cheaper 6.1-inch iPhone has been tipped before. The report adds that the cost of the 6.1-inch LCD iPhone's touch panel will increase 15 percent thanks to the use of a thin-film sensor on top of the touch-film sensor. Just why Apple is using the thin-film sensor is not known at the moment. Apple also reportedly has plans to use CGS process on all iPhone variants in the 2019 lineup.

According to Kuo, Apple's suppliers will be in for a treat as revenues will rise slightly thanks to the increased cost of the touch panel.

Earlier this week, a report had suggested that the LCD iPhone might be priced $200 (roughly Rs. 13,200) lower than the other two OLED models. This is said to be have been made possible as a result of certain cost-cutting efforts in terms of display panels, device frame, camera components, and more. In terms of design, Apple might incorporate a notch on the LCD variant, albeit with a slight bottom chin.

Previously, Ming-Chi Kuo had stated that the LCD iPhone will start from as low as $550 for the unlocked variant. Additionally, the model is said to arrive in a single SIM edition and one with dual-SIM support.",tech,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/iphone-2018-lcd-variant-to-get-cgs-process-thin-film-sensor-no-touch-id-1843789

"Apple's upcoming 6.1-inch LCD iPhone may not feature 3D Touch due to cost constraints, according to a new note shared yesterday by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and published by Chinese site Feng Kuo says that the 6.1-inch iPhone will use what he calls ""Cover Glass Sensor"" (CGS) technology, relocating the iPhone's touch module from the display panel (in-cell technology) to the surface glass. The CGS method reportedly results in a display that's lighter and more shock resistant.With this display technology, Apple will add a thin-film sensor to the touch film sensor included in the CGS, but the purpose of the new layer is unknown. It will, however, result in a 15 percent increase in the cost of the touch panel, resulting in a higher purchase price of $23 to $26.To offset the cost of the new display it plans to use, Kuo believes Apple will remove the 3D Touch functionality on the 6.1-inch iPhone, which would be a curious move as 3D Touch is well-integrated throughout the operating system that runs on the iPhone at this point.The other two iPhone models Apple is expected to release in 2018, the 5.8-inch OLED iPhone X successor and the 6.5-inch OLED device that can be thought of as an ""iPhone X Plus,"" will continue to offer 3D Touch functionality.Because Apple plans to incorporate the CGS display technology into future iPhones, including OLED models starting in 2019, 3D Touch could potentially be removed from all future iPhones.It's not clear what the mystery thin-film sensor mentioned in Kuo's note will do, but it could be some kind of 3D Touch replacement system. Apple is said to be planning to release iPhones with touchless gesture controls in the next few years, and this could be the first step towards that goal. A gesture-based system is around two years away, however, so it the film could be some other new input method to replace 3D Touch.Kuo believes the 6.1-inch iPhone will make up 65 to 75 percent of iPhone shipments during the year, given its lower price point and its feature parity with the two OLED devices Apple plans to introduce.While the 6.1-inch iPhone will not feature OLED technology, it is said to have an edge-to-edge screen design and support for Face ID, like the OLED phones in the 2018 iPhone lineup.",tech,https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/kuo-no-3d-touch-6-1-inch-2018-iphone/
"Apple is widely anticipated to introduce three new iPhones later this year with a design similar to that of the Apple iPhone X. According to analysts, two of those models will sport Samsung-made OLED displays, while the third model will stick to LCD panel. The LCD iPhone model slated for release in September is seen as Apple’s attempt to recreate the super cycle for iPhone sales.

Now, in a new memo quoted by Feng, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the LCD iPhone model will not only be cheaper than the OLED-based iPhone X, but also offer new design change. Kuo says the LCD model will use “cover glass sensor” technology in which the touch module is moved out of the display panel to the surface glass. The design change is also said to include an addition of a thin-film sensor to the mix, which will raise the cost of parts from $23 to $26.

With the switch to CGS technology, Apple might probably remove the 3D Touch support on the LCD model to bring down the final price. However, the 3D Touch technology is said to remain on this year’s OLED model. Kuo also sees scope for Apple bringing the cover glass sensor (CGS) technology to all iPhone models in 2019.

While Kuo sees Apple dropping 3D Touch to cut down the cost, there is also a counter argument stating that 3D Touch won’t go away since it is completely woven into the operating system. Another argument is the investment made by third-party developers to support the feature, and they probably won’t like it if Apple ditches the technology. According to AppleInsider, Kuo believes there is also a possibility that the thin-film sensor will act as a replacement for 3D Touch, but it is not clear how the technology will work.

The LCD iPhone, according to Kuo, is expected to feature a 6.1-inch edge-to-edge display like its OLED counterpart. It is also expected to switch to metal back in order to lower the cost and might drop support for wireless charging. Kuo predicts that the LCD model will be available at a starting price between $550 and $650. He says Apple will also introduce dual-SIM version of this LCD model, which could be priced between $650 and $750 to target consumers in markets like India and China.

Apple iPhone X for 2018 is supposed to launch in three variants and the series has seen quite a few leaks in the past few months. Now a report in Chinese publication Feng, which quotes KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, suggests that the cheapest version of iPhone X with 6.1-inch LCD screen will sport a stronger display thanks to Cover Glass Sensor (CGS) process. Apple could also ditch the 3D Touch feature on the smartphone. The CGS process will make the iPhone lighter and shock-resistant.

According to the report, Apple will a thin-film sensor in addition to the touch film sensor which will result in 15 per cent increase in the cost of touch panel of the phone. Apple is apparently removing the 3D Touch function to balance out the increased price. It adds that all iPhone models of 2019, including with OLED display will use the CGS process for touch panel and will lack the 3D Touch feature.

Kuo, in an investor note said that the cheapest iPhone X could have a starting price of $550, and that there might a variant with support for dual-SIM technology as well. That’s something Apple’s iPhones have not offered so far with its devices. Apple iPhone X models for 2018 include a new 5.8-inch iPhone X with OLED display, a bigger iPhone X with 6.5-inch OLED screen and the most affordable 6.1-inch iPhone X with LCD screen.

Notably, Bloomberg had earlier reported that 6.5-inch OLED iPhone will come with dual-SIM features. Kuo’s note also says the same thing regarding the bigger iPhone X as well. As for pricing, the LCD iPhone X model single-SIM variant could be priced at $550, which is around Rs 36,000 on conversion, while the dual SIM model will sport a price tag of $650 and $750. Reports claim the 6.1-inch iPhone will start at $799, while the iPhone X Plus will have $999 price tag.

"Product Overview

Apple iPhone X is the first bezel less phone from Apple. The display is very beautiful. The phone costs $999 at the start and makes it the most expensive iPhone ever. It is going to give a tough competition to its competitors, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8. The phone comes with a 5.8-inch display with a resolution of 1125 x 2436 pixels. It features Bluetooth 5.0 and USB lightning connector.

"The smart speaker race is heating up in India. Last year, Amazon launched its Echo lineup of smart speakers in the country with prices starting at Rs 3,499. Now, the Google Home and its smaller cousin, the Google Home Mini, have finally arrived in the country. The Google Home is a nifty little speaker that harnesses the power of the Google Assistant to play music, respond to all sorts of questions, stream movies and TV shows across to televisions, control smart home devices, and even tell jokes in a pinch. Let's see what Google's smart speaker brings to the table.

Google Home design

The Google Home has a very minimalist, clean, and inconspicuous appearance. The top half is made of plastic while the bottom is a removable mesh panel covered in fabric. The device is only available in white but the bottom panel can be swapped out to add a splash of personality.

The cylindrical design is admittedly a bit odd and quirky - most of our friends mistook this device for a fancy air freshener or a lamp. That said, it looks quite premium and is very compact. The Amazon Echo looks cold and utilitarian in comparison.

The build quality is quite decent although the use of plastic at this price does feel a bit cut-rate. While the Google Home Mini can be powered by a power bank thanks to its Micro-USB port, the regular Google Home is meant to be stationary, and uses a proprietary mains power adapter that plugs in at the bottom.

The top of the Google Home slopes at an angle and hides a touch-sensitive panel that can be used to play/ pause music and adjust the volume. The slanted top also has LEDs that light up like the colourful Google dots. There is only one physical button at the back which disables the microphones in case you’re worried about privacy.

Google Home setup and performance

The setup process is extremely simple. Provided you have a reliable Wi-Fi connection at your home or office, the Google Home app will recognise the device in a jiffy after running through a few simple steps. Three far-field microphones help the Google Home pick up voices from across a room.

The Google Home is basically a meteorologist, DJ, game show host, encyclopaedia, and work planner all rolled into one. You can ask it about random facts, the weather, directions to a specific destination, the best Chinese restaurants around you, and so on. You can also ask it to set reminders and alarms, and even create shopping lists.

The Google Home harnesses Google Assistant to fetch these results and is able to perform basic tasks like these without a hitch. That said, it is easier and more productive to do most of these things on your smartphone the old-fashioned way - by hand. For instance, asking Google Home for the best Chinese restaurants or movies playing around you presents a truncated list which cannot be expanded. While such scaled-down results are fine in a pinch, we found it easier and quite a bit more productive to open BookMyShow or Zomato on a smartphone.

That said, there are three use cases in which the Google Home excels – getting recipes, listening to the news, and playing music on request. Ask the Google Home for a particular recipe and it gives step-by-step directions. After soiling our smartphone screens for years in the kitchen, we found it incredibly convenient to have the Home simply read recipes aloud. You can ask the Google Home to give you a list of ingredients, ask it to repeat steps you missed, and find a simpler recipe if the one you are trying is just too hard. It even worked for local dishes such as Rajma Chawal and Butter Chicken, but sometimes the measurements for ingredients were in ounces, which most Indians will not be familiar with.

Having Google Home read the top news stories of the day aloud in the morning is also extremely convenient. You can customise news sources via the Google Home app but we’re limited to international sources such as Forbes, BBC, and Al-Jazeera at the moment. The Google Home can also play songs on request from Google Play Music, Gaana, and Saavn. It does a good job at recognising the names of Indian songs and artists, and can also play personal playlists if you have a paid account for any of the aforementioned services.

Your queries are logged in the Google Home app as well, which is very handy. When you ask Google Home for directions, it opens them in Google Maps in the app. Similarly, search results and certain answers are displayed in the app as well. This works a bit inconsistently though - some queries are not displayed while others are. If there is no pattern to this, we couldn't really figure it out.

The Google Home understands contextual questions as well. Asking the smart speaker “Who is their coach” after quizzing it on who won the English Premier League last year yields the name of the same team’s coach. You can even take this a step further and ask “How tall is he” and “Where is he from”, and Google Home understands that you’re referring to the same person and responds accordingly. Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri lack such contextual understanding of text flow.

The Google Home can act as a game show host as well. At the moment, there are two multi-player games built-in - Lucky Trivia and Crystal Ball - with more promised for the future. The games are a nice way to impress people and kill time with friends.

In our experience, the Google Home understood Indian accents very well and did not trip over complex names of Indian artists and albums such as ‘Harris Jayaraj’ and ‘OK Kanmani’. Hindi language support is coming later this year which should further enhance the appeal of the smart speaker.

You can club multiple actions together into “routines”. Say “Ok Google, I am home”, and the Google Home can turn on the lights, and play some relaxing tunes via Play Music.

While all this sounds extremely nifty and futuristic, the Google Home’s functionality is a bit limited in India as of now. Unlike the Amazon Echo, the Home cannot be used to book cabs or make hotel and flight reservations. It lacks a lot of local content at the moment. Add to that the nascent stage of smart home technology in India, and the smart speaker loses some of its sheen.

The Philips Hue ecosystem is one of the few smart home products supported by the Google Home at the moment. Sync the Home and the Philips Hue lights successfully, and you will be able to turn them on and off, dim them, and even change their colour using voice commands.

Google Home audio quality

How does the Google Home fare as a speaker? In a nutshell: average. The Google Home is surprisingly loud for its size. It is more than capable of filling a moderately sized room with sound thanks to the 360-degree speakers that fire in all directions. That said, the actual sound quality is nothing to write home about.

The Google Home has a 2-inch driver and dual 2-inch passive radiators. In our experience, it distorted at high volume and vocals in particular sounded muffled. The mids were repressed and got lost in the sound mix, and the highs lacked sparkle and clarity. To give credit where it is due, the dual 2-inch passive radiators deliver a considerable amount of bass, which makes the Google Home well suited for predominantly bass-heavy genres such as EDM, R&B, and Hip-Hop.

The Google Home can be used as a plain-old vanilla Bluetooth speaker as well. All you need to do is say “Okay Google, connect”, and the Google Home starts looking for pairable devices. Just say “Okay Google, disconnect” when you are done pumping tunes from your laptop or smartphone, and the Google Home disconnects. It really is that simple.

We actually preferred using the Google Home as a Bluetooth speaker, because casting music via W-Fi is quite arduous. While the music quality is superior, casting is slow and quite buggy - there is a perceptible lag between hitting play and the music starting to play.

The Google Home can also be connected to any Bluetooth-enabled speaker - a great way to enhance its rather limited audio capabilities. We hooked it up to a Bose Solo 5 soundbar without any issues whatsoever.

After the initial excitement died down, we found ourselves using the Google Home for three things in particular - listening to relaxing tunes at night via Google Play Music, setting up timers, and listening to the news.

That is the biggest issue with smart speakers in general, and especially in India where smart home products aren’t widely available. The Google Home also lacks certain basic capabilities at the moment. The first few days of ownership are a blur of excitement and experimentation, after which the speaker is only used for a few, specific things. We can imagine the Google Home being useful for playing music on request, taking reminders, in the kitchen, or for someone who has a lot of smart home devices.

There are also the privacy implications of having a device that is ‘always listening’ in your house - even though Google says that nothing is sent to their servers till the ‘Ok Google’ trigger word is said. The Google Home is also intrinsically linked to your Google account which might also deter some people already apprehensive of the amount of information Google is collecting.

The fact that the Google Home Mini can also be connected to any Bluetooth speaker dampens the appeal of the Google Home slightly. If you already have decent speakers, it makes much more sense to buy the less expensive Google Home Mini, which has many of the same capabilities.

Verdict

There simply isn’t a practical and pragmatic reason at the moment to buy the Google Home over similarly priced Bluetooth speakers such as the JBL Charge 2+ which offer better sound quality. Almost everything a smart speaker does can be done manually.

However, the Google Home is a great futuristic alternative to a vanilla Bluetooth speaker that could make your life a little more convenient - at the expense of sound quality. While most of the Google Home functions can be achieved by the Google Assistant on a smartphone, a large part of the appeal of the Google Home lies in the fact that it lacks a screen. It somehow just feels much more natural to ask someone - albeit a machine - for the weather or a recipe. Not only does it feel less mechanical, it also takes you away from the multitude of distractions offered by a smartphone.

Is the Google Home a game changer? No, not yet at least. However it is a nifty gadget that has a lot of potential waiting to be tapped. Buyers considering it should also take a look at the Google Home Mini, which can be connected to any Bluetooth speaker and leaves a much smaller dent in your pocket.

"Amazon’s made a slew of acquisitions in the area of smart home services, and now it’s offering a product that brings them together under one roof — your roof.

Amazon has quietly launched a portal offering home security services — which include all the equipment you would need and in-person visits from Amazon consultants to advise and install the kit. The packages are being sold in five price tiers, at a flat fee — no monthly service contracts, a significant disruption of how many home security services are sold today.

The least expensive, $240 for Outdoor Base, gives you an Echo Dot plus indoor and outdoor lighting designed “to make it look like you’re home.” The most expensive tier, $840 for Smartest, includes an alarm siren, motion sensors, safety sensors, a camera, and Echo Dot, the lighting and a video doorbell — potentially rolling in previous security launches from the company like Amazon Key and Cloud Cam. All include two visits from Amazon employees to consult you and help with the installation.

Last July it emerged that Amazon was quietly working on its own answer to Best Buy’s Geek Squad — offering repairs and installations of home WiFi, smart home devices, Alexa installations, and other hardware-related services.

Amazon never appeared to confirm it at the time, but that service now officially seems to be called “Smart Home Services” and it has expanded to Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Texas, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington D.C. and Florida.

The security offering we are describing here — which was initially flagged to us by a reader — falls under that general banner, and it is being promoted at the top of the Smart Home Services homepage. Judging by the user reviews of the consultants, it appears to have been around since at least December.

Giving consumers the option of a more full-service security offering, beyond selling alarms and other devices a la carte, makes sense for a couple of reasons.

The first is that while there are some early adopters who might like the challenge of installing these services themselves, there will be many middle and later adopters who will not be interested in facing that learning curve.

Amazon has positioned itself in the smart home security space as more than just a reseller of third-party devices — although it sells those, too — with acquisitions of the smart doorbell startup Ring and the smart camera and doorbell startup Blink.

The second is that most often, home security systems are coupled with service installations in your home that include maintenance contracts. So if Amazon hopes to eat up some of that market, it needs to offer something comparable.

It’s an interesting development also of the company’s wider strategy to move into selling services, beyond physical products. Services is one of Amazon’s various efforts to diversify its business by targeting different categories of commerce and different demographics.

Another foray into human-powered services was its Thumbtack-style competitor Amazon Home Services, a marketplace it launched back in 2015 for finding tradespeople and other freelance service providers like masseurs and language tutors. (Notably, Amazon makes a big deal on its security pages of using Amazon employees to install its security systems.)

Earlier this month, it also emerged that Amazon was stealing a march on Apple in smart homes, specifically by inking deals with smart home builders, who were opting for Amazon as their preferred supplier for consulting and installing such services for their home buyers.

A report in The Information noted that one such home builder, Lennar, was “prioritizing Amazon” in its recommendations, while still working with Apple, in part because of the former company’s stronger efforts to integrate with more third-party products, giving buyers a wider range of choices.

Ramping up into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it happens, is directly linked now on Amazon’s security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not exclusive to Lennar homeowners.

We’ve asked Amazon about the security service pages, and the company has acknowledged the question but still has not replied. We’ll update this post as and if we learn more.",tech,https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/26/amazon-is-now-selling-home-security-services-including-installations-and-no-monthly-fees/
"Amazon has introduced a new portal offering home security services, as reported by TechCrunch. The portal offers an array of smart security packages that include items like entryway sensors, sirens, and a video doorbell, all installed by Amazon employees and offered with no monthly contract.

There are five different tiers to choose from. The cheapest sells for $240 and is designed to create the illusion that you’re home, coming with various motion-detecting lights, smart indoor lighting, and a wireless waterproof speaker. On the other end of the spectrum, the most expensive option goes for $840 and comes with items like a smart flood and leak sensor, a Wink hub, entryway sensors, and a Ring doorbell. All the packages include an Amazon Echo Dot and two visits from an Amazon smart home expert: one to identify what your needs are, and a second to install and configure all the devices.

Amazon’s foray into providing home security packages isn’t a complete surprise. Amazon introduced its own version of Best Buy’s Geek Squad last year to offer free Alexa consultations and installations for smart home products like Ecobee thermostats and Arlo security cameras. Last December, Amazon acquired battery-powered connected camera and doorbell startup Blink, and just a few months ago, agreed to also acquire smart home company Ring for more than $1 billion.

These security packages offered by Amazon naturally include products from its portfolio (like Ring and Echo) and open up the possibility of signing up even more people to services like Amazon Key, which allows couriers to unlock your front door to place packages inside your home.

Based upon reviews, it appears Amazon has been offering these services for a few months, but it’s unclear which markets it’s actually available in, or if there are plans for a nationwide roll out.",tech,https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/27/17291134/amazon-smart-security-packages-installation
"Google's vow when launching Assistant was that it'd be an ever-present service available on all of your most-used devices with a consistent experience and knowledge base no matter where you accessed it. That in many cases has ended up being true — with a few exceptions, you can talk to Google Assistant on different devices and expect the same results. That is, of course, if you actually use Google Assistant on multiple devices. In my case, I find myself using Google Home on a daily basis ... but I almost never use Google Assistant on my phone.

Google Home has become a part of my daily routine.

Throughout the course of the day, I'll always find reasons to use Google Assistant on one of my two Google Homes. I'll use the Home Mini on my nightstand as an alarm or to listen to a podcast for a few minutes in the morning. In the kitchen, I'll ask my Google Home to give me a weather report for the day and then play some music while I prepare breakfast. Later in the day my girlfriend and I will no doubt have some bevy of questions that are quickly answered by the nearest Home, not to mention cooking timers and frequent reminders. Sure, I'm not using it for the most advanced features — we explicitly don't have any home automation gear — but the point is that I always use Google Home for something throughout the day. I find it works quite well and I'm rarely frustrated with its inability to do what I want purely using voice.

So why is it that I haven't launched Google Assistant on my phone in weeks? Well, it's simple: I have a better way to get the information I need on my phone. A big screen, with a bunch of powerful apps that I'm accustomed to using that don't necessarily have hooks into Google Assistant. By just unlocking my phone, opening up the app that I know I need and finding what I want, I remove any uncertainty I'd have that Google Assistant on the phone would be able to do what I want. Yes, Google Assistant on my phone can offer up weather information or answer a random question just like my Google Home can — but the difference is that I expect to do far more than that on my phone. And I don't want to talk to it for a small subset of things when I still have to interact with the display for everything else.

In short, it's the fact that I have a display and touch available to me that makes Assistant on a phone superfluous in almost all cases. Google Home, on the other hand, only has voice interaction, and so my expectations for what it can do are limited — therefore I only give it queries for what I know it can reasonably handle. By comparison, using voice on my phone is far more likely to come up short of what I need it to do considering the wide range of things my phone is capable of, pushing me to then do that thing a second time with the screen — at that point I might as well skip the whole thing and go straight to touch.

When you have a better way of interacting with a device, you take it — touch is better than voice in most cases.

Yes, there are situations in which touch isn't an option, like when I'm driving using Android Auto, or if I'm elbow-deep in some dishes in the sink — but those situations are fringe cases, not daily requirements. We all have years of experience using smartphones with touch, and when that's a viable option for interaction we'll always take it. That's not a slight on how useful Google Assistant is — I've found in my daily life that it certainly is useful — but that touch is just a faster, more accurate way to get things done on a phone. And phone screens just keep getting bigger to facilitate that.

Whether this is actually an ""issue"" from Google's perspective isn't quite clear. Clearly Google Assistant has to be really good on the Home in order for people to keep using it, considering it's the only way to interact with the device. But on a phone ... Google Assistant feels like it's there for cross-compatibility and completeness more than as a tool to be used on a daily basis to truly change how we interact with our phones. Google obviously admitted that voice isn't perfect for all use cases when it launched typing support in Assistant on phones ... but could it eventually go further to make phone-specific changes to the way Assistant works? I think it needs to, because right now it isn't compelling enough to make me talk to my phone.",tech,https://www.androidcentral.com/i-use-google-assistant-every-day-google-home-never-my-phone
"Xiaomi Redmi S2's imminent launch is hinted by its 3C listing

Key features of the Redmi S2 were revealed in a recent TENAA listing

The Redmi S2 could borrow the same design strategy as the Redmi Note 5 Pro

After paving a successful route forward in 2017, Xiaomi is moving at a faster pace this year. The Chinese smartphone maker started 2018 with the release of Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro along with many other devices in the pipeline. The company is now rolling out another affordable Xiaomi Redmi phone and it is widely anticipated to be the Redmi S2.

There have been plenty rumors about the Redmi S2 so far, but nothing is conclusive. However, there's new evidence to support the Redmi S2's imminent arrival. As spotted by 91Mobiles, the new affordable Redmi smartphone was spotted on 3C (Compulsory Certification of China), which suggests the Redmi S2 is indeed coming.

The question about Redmi S2's launch date is still a mystery, but media reports suggest it could take a few months. The 3C listing for the Redmi S2 doesn't give any information about the device, but we've had previous reports outlining the possible features of the handset.

Xiaomi Redmi S2

Xiaomi Redmi S2 was recently spotted on TENNA, another Chinese certification website, where several details about the handset were revealed.

"Xiaomi Redmi S2's imminent launch is hinted by its 3C listing

Key features of the Redmi S2 were revealed in a recent TENAA listing

The Redmi S2 could borrow the same design strategy as the Redmi Note 5 Pro

After paving a successful route forward in 2017, Xiaomi is moving at a faster pace this year. The Chinese smartphone maker started 2018 with the release of Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro along with many other devices in the pipeline. The company is now rolling out another affordable Xiaomi Redmi phone and it is widely anticipated to be the Redmi S2.

There have been plenty rumors about the Redmi S2 so far, but nothing is conclusive. However, there's new evidence to support the Redmi S2's imminent arrival. As spotted by 91Mobiles, the new affordable Redmi smartphone was spotted on 3C (Compulsory Certification of China), which suggests the Redmi S2 is indeed coming.

The question about Redmi S2's launch date is still a mystery, but media reports suggest it could take a few months. The 3C listing for the Redmi S2 doesn't give any information about the device, but we've had previous reports outlining the possible features of the handset.

Xiaomi Redmi S2 was recently spotted on TENNA, another Chinese certification website, where several details about the handset were revealed.

According to leaked reports, the Redmi S2 is expected to feature a 5.99-inch HD+ display, dual rear camera setup with 12MP and 8MP sensors and a 16MP front snapper. Under the hood, it will likely sport a Snapdragon 625 chipset clocking at 2GHz.

"Over the course of the last three years, Xiaomi went from a relatively unknown Chinese brand to India's largest smartphone manufacturer. It did so by introducing budget phones that offered great value for money, and eliminating common pain points. For instance, one of the areas Xiaomi focused on last year was battery life — it started rolling out phones with larger batteries and offering optimizations within MIUI to eke out the maximum battery life. As a result, Xiaomi's phones consistently lead the charts when it comes to battery life. The mixture of two-day battery life and decent specs allowed the Redmi Note 4 to become the best-selling phone in India last year, and the Redmi Note 5 Pro builds on that by offering beefier hardware and a better camera — while retaining the same great battery life. Xiaomi's ability to undercut its rivals is unmatched in the industry, and it does so not only in the phone segment, but also with its lifestyle products. That's why the launch of the ZenFone Max Pro M1 is such a momentous occasion — ASUS is effectively beating Xiaomi at its own game, and that should be worrisome to India's leading smartphone brand. The ZenFone Max Pro M1 offers the same Snapdragon 636 chipset as the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but it comes with pure Android and retails at a lower price point. It's time to find out if ASUS' latest budget phone has what it takes to dethrone the Redmi Note 5 Pro.

Where they're both equal

Both phones offer robust hardware in the form of a Snapdragon 636 chipset, along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Xiaomi also sells a version with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and ASUS has mentioned that it will also offer a similar configuration of the M1 at a later date. Where ASUS has an advantage, though, is with the base variant of the Max Pro M1, which has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The base version costs just ₹10,999 ($165), which is an absolute steal when you consider the specs on offer. The only device that Xiaomi has at that price point is the standard Redmi Note 5, which is powered by the Snapdragon 625. Both devices also sport 5.99-inch IPS LCD displays with a resolution of 2160x1080, and the panels are identical. Both offer vibrant colors and great viewing angles, and although I faced issues with the ambient light sensor on the M1 initially, that particular issue was alleviated in a recent software update. Both the ZenFone Max Pro M1 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro have 3.5mm jacks, and Xiaomi does one better by including an IR blaster — a mainstay on its phones for some years now. What the Redmi Note 5 Pro does better

Xiaomi hasn't really altered the design of its Redmi Note series for a few generations, instead opting to refine the aesthetic to differentiate the latest phones from their predecessors. That said, the Redmi Note 5 Pro is one of the most sturdily-built phones in this segment, and the fit and finish is top-notch.

You don't necessarily get the same feeling when you're using the ZenFone Max Pro M1. Although the device has a 5000mAh battery — 1000mAh more than the Redmi Note 5 Pro — it is 1g lighter than Xiaomi's phone, and that's likely due to the quality of the metals used in its construction. It certainly doesn't feel as sturdy, and there isn't a whole lot to get excited about on the design front in general. The Redmi Note 5 Pro has a much more refined design. Furthermore, the 5.99-inch screen on the M1 is devoid of any protection, so you'll have to pick up a screen protector. Xiaomi doesn't necessarily specify what version of Gorilla Glass it is using on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but there's some sort of protection against tumbles. There isn't much to separate either phone in terms of the camera. The ZenFone Max Pro M1 has a slight edge when it comes to outdoor shots, and the Redmi Note 5 Pro wins out indoors. As for low-light shots, you get to see more details on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but the colors are washed out. ZenFone Max Pro M1 on the left, Redmi Note 5 Pro on the right. I couldn't get the portrait mode to work reliably on the ZenFone Max Pro M1, and in this area the Redmi Note 5 Pro does better. Right now, the Redmi Note 5 Pro has the edge when it comes to the camera side of things. That said, my Max Pro M1 is running a non-final software build, and ASUS has stated that it will significantly alter the camera quality in the coming weeks. The stable build for the device is set to go live on April 29, and I'll revisit this section after the Max Pro M1 goes on sale to see if there's a tangible difference. What the ZenFone Max Pro M1 does better

There are three areas where the ZenFone Max Pro M1 wins out over the Redmi Note 5 Pro: software, battery life, and value for money. ASUS said that it decided to go with pure Android in lieu of ZenUI following feedback from the Indian community, and the move is a welcome one. For one thing, the M1 comes with Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box, whereas Xiaomi hasn't detailed a timeline yet for when the Redmi Note 5 Pro will be updated to Oreo. The software experience on the M1 still needs some polish, and ASUS has mentioned that it will have a public build ready in time for the phone's release on May 3. For what it's worth, the company has done a decent job in terms of rolling out stability updates over the last week, and it feels much better optimized than when I got my hands on it earlier this month. With a 5000mAh battery under the hood, the ZenFone Max Pro M1 could just turn out to be the battery champion in this category. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also delivers two days' worth of use from a full charge, but the M1 edges it out. Then there's the pricing: ASUS is clearly going after the Redmi Note 5 Pro by pricing the Max Pro M1 at just ₹10,999, making it one of the best deals in the budget segment today. Xiaomi doesn't have the same brand cachet as Samsung or even Nokia, and the main reason it was able to edge out other manufacturers in this category was because of its ability to undercut its rivals. ASUS is beating Xiaomi where it counts: value for money. That was the main draw for millions of customers picking up Xiaomi hardware, and now that ASUS is offering a similar package, it isn't hard not to see buyers switching allegiances. Furthermore, ASUS' decision to offer pure Android is a masterstroke. Xiaomi didn't make matters any easier for itself by selling the Redmi Note 5 Pro in weekly flash sales, which meant that a majority of buyers that were interested in picking up the device weren't able to do so. It's been over two months since the Redmi Note 5 Pro went on sale, and the fact that it still isn't available on open sale speaks volumes of Xiaomi's predicament. The flash sales strategy worked fine for the vendor when it was an underdog trying to out-maneuver the likes of Samsung, but by relying on the same tactics even now, Xiaomi is showing that it doesn't have the necessary experience to operate at this level.

"The Honor 7X is one of the best phones you can buy for under $200, and as Hayato reported in late March , it's made even better with EMUI 8.0 (Honor's custom version of Android Oreo). EMUI 8.0's been available as a beta for the Honor 7X for over a month now, but on April 30, it'll be pushed to all users in the United States.

EMUI 8.0 includes all of the Oreo features we've come to know and love, such as picture-in-picture, Google's Autofill API, the new emoji style, etc. Honor's also included a heap of its own features, and some of them sound pretty great.

Most notably, EMUI 8.0 adds a new face unlock system to the 7X. Similar to what we've seen on the OnePlus 5T and other handsets, face unlock on the 7X allows you to quickly access your phone using the front-facing camera. It's not as secure as the iPhone X's Face ID, but it's still a very welcome touch.

Also included with the update is the ability to connect two Bluetooth devices at once, access Android's navigation buttons anywhere using a floating navigation dock, restore photos you accidentally deleted in Honor's Gallery app, and the Settings menu has been drastically simplified.

If you've been holding off on the 7X, now's looking like the perfect time to finally pick one up.

"Android Oreo brings a lot of new features and also latest security patch to LG G6

Android Oreo is expected to be released first to LG G6 in South Korea and later to other global regions

South Korean smartphone-maker LG officially announced the Android Oreo release timeline for the company's former flagship phone G6.

The company in press note revealed that the Google's chocolate-milk cookie-flavored software will be rolled out to the LG G6 from April 30 onward. It will be initially made available in the LG's home country South Korea and later in other global regions.

After the LG G6, the company is expected to expand the Android Oreo roll-out to the V20 series in coming weeks.

What's coming in Android Oreo?

Android Oreo comes with numerous improvements over Android Nougat v7.0, including extended battery life achieved by cutting down on unnecessary activities of apps in the background, faster booting, more fluid experiences as well as improvements in security via Google security patch (February 2018) and also Google Play Protect, which keeps a tab on suspicious activities and malware in apps.

Additionally, it also brings Smart Text Selection to improve copy and paste option. With the help of machine learning to recognize entities on the screen—like a complete address—users will be able to easily select text they want with a double tap, and even bring up an app like Maps to help during navigation.

There is also a picture-in-picture feature, which enables device owners to do multi-tasking, like checking the calendar while planning a party on a Duo video call.

A praiseworthy aspect of the Android Oreo is the Rescue Party feature, which helps the device recover from constant boot loops.

There's more...

"Reliance Jio and rival telecom operators have continued to engage in a cutthroat competition by offering attractive plans at lower prices and higher data benefits. Airtel and Reliance Jio both have introduced a slew of data packs under Rs 50. Recently, Airtel launched a Rs 49 plan that offers 3GB of 4G data with validity of 1 day. In comparison, Reliance Jio’s Rs 49 plan offers 1GB of 4G data with validity of 28 days. Unlike Airtel’s data only offer this plan also gives unlimited voice calls, 50 SMS, and free access to Jio apps.

Apart from Rs 49 plan, the two companies offer a range of affordable data plans. Here’s a look at prepaid plans below Rs 50 offered by both Airtel and Reliance Jio.

Airtel

Airtel has quite a few plans available under Rs 50. These plans come with just data or bundled with calls and SMS. The cheapest offering is Airtel’s Rs 9 plan which offers users unlimited local, STD and roaming calls. This plan also offers 100MB of data and 100 SMS with one day validity.

There’s one priced at Rs 18 which offers 100MB of 2G/3G/4G data with 2 days of validity. Airtel’s prepaid plan priced at Rs 23 offers unlimited local, STD and roaming calls with 200MB of data and 100 SMS per day. This plan has validity of two days.

At Rs 24 Airtel users get 135MB of 2G/3G/4G data with three days validity, and 200MB of data for Rs 28 but with five days validity. With longer validity of 28 days, Airtel users can opt for Rs 29 plan which offers 150MB of 3G/4G data.

Lastly, there’s one plan priced at Rs 48 which offers 400MB of 2G/3G/4G data with 10 days validity.

Reliance Jio

While there are quite a few plans to choose from for Airtel, Jio offers only two one of which is priced at Rs 49. The other prepaid plan available under Rs 50 is priced at Rs 19 and comes with one day validity. Under this plan Jio users get 0.15GB of 4G data along with unlimited voice calls. There’s also 20 free SMS and free access to Jio’s suite of apps.",tech,https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/airtel-vs-reliance-jio-top-data-plans-under-rs-50-compared/story-Jru1bK583Lb3FJKRDu0QpI.html
"GOOGLE'S OTHER NEWS is back for another week. If you want the hot-button issues, then go here (afterwards, manners cost nothing) for a full list of Google coverage this week. Meanwhile here are some of the one-line info, and believable rumours doing the rounds, interspersed with some free apps.

First this week - the mystery of Fuchsia OS has taken a not entirely unexpected turn with the arrival of Android runtime. What this means, for the non-tech-heads, is that whatever Fuchsia is, it will run legacy apps. And if that means it's the fabled coming together of Chrome OS and Android, then this is a big step. Maybe we'll finally learn more at I/O.

Three For Free: Mind Games Pro (£2.69)

Although the Brain Training fad seems to have died down, the inherent reason it started hasn't changed - stretching your mind is good for you. As such, if you're the sort of person that plays mind games, make it these Mind Games while they're free.

As of yet, we don't have an official on this, but it sounds like Google Play Music is going to be retired - rolled in with YouTube Red under the name YouTube Remix. This presents a whole wadge of questions - will you still be able to buy or just stream? Will they run concurrently to start with? Will we finally be able to access our Google songs in Drive like we do with Google Photos? All will be revealed, but if the rumours are true, GPM could go this year. We'd bet against downloads being part of any new service - Microsoft has ditched Groove this year, and Google has gone from selling bargain MP3s to virtually no discounts at all - not a sign its committed to the format.

Three For Free: Mosalingua Learn Brazil-Portuguese (£4.99)

Every few weeks, Mosalingua offers another of its language courses for diddly-squat. We like them and saving a fiver is definitely a good advert for them. As such, why not learn Brazil-Portuguese this weekend? Shame it's too late for the Olympics really.

Another big mystery is when exactly we're going to see a Google Home device with a screen. At the moment, several third parties are working with Google, but there's no official device. And we'd give a quiet side bet that when it does happen, it'll be the flagship device from the first batch of Nest products since Google took the company back under its wing. Again, just a rumour, but seems likely.

Three For Free: Widget Maker (£3.19)

Widgets are what separates Google from iOS. The home screen info-packs have no peer with Apple and they can be useful for all sorts of things. If your needs aren't being served, why not make your own? And if that's not good enough, there's a Clock Maker app that's also free. So that's sort of your fourth of three for the week.

And finally this week - while we're all drooling over the long overdue Gmail interface that launched this week (if you haven't found it yet, click the ""cog"" item in the top right, and there's an option to ""try the new Gmail"") there's talk that Chrome will be next for a facelift. There's a fair bet that it's accurate because it's already live in the Canary channel showing a design evolution that is almost imperceptible unless you are looking.

But test channels aren't a guarantee of something that is going to launch - any show-stopping bugs between now, the Beta channel next month and the stable channel at the end of June would delay it for an indeterminate length of time.

That's it for now. More next week.

"We have so many choices when it comes to our entertainment. We can watch YouTube on our phones, our TVs come with ""smart apps"" of varying ease and intelligence, and then there are set-top and streaming devices like Roku, Google Chromecast and Android TV. There's a lot of ways to consume your media, and a lot of tools for it, but the most popular one isn't your phone or your tablet ... it's your remote. That's right, for tens of millions of tech users who grew up with TV and old-school cable, the siren song of the remote is just too powerful, and it keeps pulling me back in.

Once upon a time in 2014, I was in love with my Chromecasts. Set-top boxes and smart TVs were out of my fresh-out-of-college budget, but at $35 — and still $35 today — the Chromecast was firmly in impulse buy territory, and it was a snap to install and use. Back in 2014, the list of apps that used it was still relatively small, but for the apps that weren't supported, I could simply cast from my trusty Chromebook. The experience wasn't flawless, as my subpar router would often drop a connection mid-episode and force me to restart my cast — or worse, restart my episode — but it was cheap, it was easy, and 90% of the time it worked.

This love affair carried on for two years, and in that time I took on my parents' old 42-inch ""dumb"" TV, happy that it worked with the Chromecast. I looked at the apps on this Vizio TV back home and cringed. It took close to a minute for Netflix or YouTube to open, and even with a QWERTY remote, it still took forever to find anything to watch. I could already be casting what I wanted to see while they were waiting for the app to load, so why wouldn't they just use the Chromecast plugged into the back of their TV? I didn't understand why they'd settle for a slower, clunkier UI using the boring old remote. Then I got an NVIDIA Shield TV as a Christmas present in 2015, and my Chromecasting days ended the minute I opened the box.

My Shield TV came with a remote and a game controller, and that controller soon became my best friend. Even though the Shield TV comes with Chromecasting built in, I've used it maybe two dozen times, and all of those times have been for music. Even though it takes me longer to find what I want to watch using a remote, it just feels easier to use the remote rather than pulling up app after app on my phone looking for something to cast. The remote is convenient, especially if my phone is across the room or being used for other tasks, like gaming or taking screenshots for my articles. Now, this isn't to say that the remote on the Shield TV is something special. As a matter of fact, the actual remote experience pales in comparison to using the controller, as the D-pads on the controller are the best tools for speedy scrolling and seeking, short of flicking up and down on a touchscreen. And I can't deny it, a touchscreen offers a far faster experience for finding content, but when watching that content, Chromecasting doesn't offer the kind of quick playback control that remote-enabled systems do. Yeah, you can pause using the remote, but if you want to rewind, even just 10 seconds to hear the joke that got covered up by a timer going off, you have to pull your phone back out to seek. As someone who is notorious for skipping around in the episodes and movies she watches, this meant that even if the remote takes longer to get my content, I'll be able to watch it more easily once my urge to skip a scene strikes.",tech,https://www.androidcentral.com/lure-remote-chromecast
"It’s a mix of urban legend and science—how to maximize the battery life of your smart phone. iPhone, Android or other, all phones have their limits, and long-days in the field put the devices to their test—particularly when you forget the charging cord.

Here’s a curated list of some ideas to help give you that extra five minutes for a phone call.

Research in how your phone uses its battery

Look to see which of your apps use the most battery power. On iPhones and Android phones, open “Settings” and in the Battery menu, you’ll find a sorted list of apps by the amount of battery power they use.

Then, you can disable the background activities of apps. Here’s a summary from this article in the NY Times: On an iPhone, go “Settings”, select “General”, and then “Background App Refresh.” From that list you can disable the background activities, which consume battery reserves. On an Android phone, go to “Settings”, select “Data Usage,” choose an app, then select “Restrict Background Data.”

Keep your phone out of the sunlight.

Avoid putting your phone in the direct sunlight or even warm surfaces as it will drain your battery faster.

Set your phone to automatic lock

Most sources cite that a smartphone’s screen consumes the most energy of any component. Enabling auto-lock minimizes the time your phone screen consumes battery while you aren’t actively using it.

Turn off the vibrate function

Unless the vibrate function is the only way for you to know when your phone is ringing, consider disabling it.

Turn down the brightness of your screen or use the auto-brightness feature.

This idea comes with some discussion. The debate comes from whether to use auto-brightness, or to operate with minimum brightness whenever possible.

One report conducted by The Wirecutter found using auto-brightness saved a good amount of battery life. That report also showed in an hourlong test, an iPhone 6s used 54% less battery power with the screen brightness at minimum as compared with maximum brightness. An Android test phone used 30% less.

While some sources advocate you operate your phone at the minimally required brightness, that gets tricky out in the middle of a corn field in the full sun.

Play music downloaded to the phone, rather than streaming it.

In the same above mentioned Wirecutter series of tests, streaming music over a Wi-Fi connection for two hours used 10% of an iPhone’s battery. Streaming the same music stored directly on a device over two hours consumed only 5%.

It’s okay to use chargers not made by the phone manufacturers.

Charging equipment from reputable vendors is just as effective and safe. As this article explains, internally the phone contains all of the circuitry that charges the battery—so charging equipment can’t hurt your phone’s battery. That said, some budget models of chargers can be poorly made or use low-quality components. A poor-quality charger may damage your phone or expose you to dangerous currents.

There are two other tactics worth experimenting with.

Some say to close all unused apps from the background. Others say it doesn’t matter and you can leave them all open. In fact, if you close them only to restart the app, it may require more power from the phone battery.

Some sources say to turn off and disable GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. But, say you are in range of a strong wi-fi signal (which isn’t in the middle of a most corn fields) your phone will use less power with a good wi-fi connection. So if you are working in the shed, next to the farm office, you could save battery by relying on wi-fi.",tech,https://www.agprofessional.com/article/8-tips-extend-your-phone-battery-during-long-days-field
"The used smartphone market is huge and if you do not take the correct precautions you might not get the best deal The used smartphone market is huge and if you do not take the correct precautions you might not get the best deal

Smartphone manufacturers have been frequently launching new smartphones making their last ones feel old pretty soon. This plays a lot with the mindset of people who want to have the latest and the greatest. These people then purchase the newer smartphones and do not know what to do with the older ones. So they decide to sell them off, which creates a huge supply of used smartphones in the market. Then the people who do not want to spend much but want a decent phone turn to the second hand smartphone market to get a good deal. However, if they do not know much about the device and just go and pick up some device from the seller they can be scammed. So we decided to compile a list of five things that you need to do before paying for a second hand smartphone.

Find out the current price of the phone you are looking to buy

There are many online shopping sites which let users sell off their used smartphones to others There are many online shopping sites which let users sell off their used smartphones to others

If you are going to buy a used smartphone, the main motivation behind that is getting a good deal. However, to know if you are actually getting it for a good price, a little bit of prior research is needed. The first thing that you need to look for is how much does a new piece of the same cost in the market right now. Then you need to check multiple marketplaces and figure how many people are selling the device and for how much. After doing that and getting a feel of the market, you can decide on how much you are willing to spend on it and in what condition are you willing to accept the device in. Then you can contact the seller and bargain a bit to get the most out of your buck.

Check for physical damage

Any physical damage brings down the price of a smartphone Any physical damage brings down the price of a smartphone

When you have decided on a price and have setup a meeting with a seller, the easy part is over. Now, before you pay and leave with the phone, you need to check the smartphone for any visible damages that you can spot. Check for dents, scratches, water damage, or any parts wobbling or coming out. If you see any damages that you can deal with then, it might also help you bargain a bit. Like a minor scratch on the back might help you bring the seller of the device down by Rs 500 or more. Just make sure there aren’t any major issues with the smartphone so that you do not repent later. To check for water damage you just need to find the water test sticker on the phone and see if it is still the original colour. To know where the water damage sticker might be, just Google it with the model name of the smartphone.

Time for technical checks

Checking all the ports of a used smartphone is a good idea, as you do not know what might be broken Checking all the ports of a used smartphone is a good idea, as you do not know what might be broken

Now that you are done with the external checks of the smartphone, you need to check that the internals are in the right condition too. For this we recommend you take a power bank, a charging cable, a working SIM card, a microSD card and a pair of headphones with you. This will help you check each and every port of the device. Try making calls, sending messages to check if the internal modems are all working, check the charging and the 3.5mm port along with all the physical buttons on the phone. Open up the phone if you can and check to see if the battery is not bloated. Finally touch everywhere on the screen to see if the touch is responding properly or not.

Check if the phone is rooted or jailbroken

Bypassing the walls that the operating system has setup might lead to unfavourable outcomes Bypassing the walls that the operating system has setup might lead to unfavourable outcomes

After all the physical tests mentioned above are done and you are satisfied with the condition of the smartphone. It is time to check if the software is in proper condition and hasn’t been tinkered with. If you find a smartphone that is rooted or jailbroken this might be a big problem. The previous owner might have tinkered a lot with the software and might have even overclocked the processor thus burning it a bit at least. Jailbroken iPhones cannot use the App Store to download apps and might get locked if upgraded to a newer version of iOS.

Use the phone for a bit of time to see if it works properly

Using a smartphone for some time like your daily driver will help you figure out if there is something wrong there with the smartphone Using a smartphone for some time like your daily driver will help you figure out if there is something wrong there with the smartphone

Finally, after all of the above checks are done comes the turn to actually use it as you would normally do. We recommend that you spend at least 30 minutes with the device using it thoroughly to see how smooth it works. During this you may even find something that you missed in the above tests. Using the smartphone will also make you see if you are comfortable with it – is it too big or small, is the operating system easy to learn for you and much more. Using a smartphone for 30 minutes might seem like a long and tedious task at the beginning, but when you think that, that is the smartphone you will be using as your daily driver for quite some time, it doesn’t seem that long.

Now that all of the above tests are done and you are happy with the deal, it’s time for payment. But wait! One major check still remains. Ask the seller for the original invoice and box (at least the former) to know for sure that he or she is the rightful owner of the device and it isn’t stolen. Once you have the original invoice in hand, give the seller what you agreed upon and be the happy owner of that smartphone

The nice part about buying a good second hand smartphone is that you will end up losing a lot less money when you sell the smartphone in the future compared to selling a new smartphone.

"Clean Shaven Kratos in High Definition is Just as Weird as You Would Expect

One of the most notable changes to God of War isn’t Kratos’s new axe. It’s his full beard. Of course, nothing is sacred, and Sony Santa Monica decided to release a rendering of a clean shaven Kratos, without his new beard. In fact, this new image of Kratos comes without any trace of hair at all. Even his eyebrows are missing! If you want to view the full high-definition beardlessness, click on the image below.

Apparently the Leviathan Axe doubles as a straight razor, because that is a tight and clean shave. Once you get past the horror of baby-face Kratos, it’s fascinating to see how much detail went into aging the Ghost of Sparta’s ashen skin and signature red tattoo. Even his scarring looks aged.

For a quick comparison of Kratos with the beard and this eerily uncanny shaved Kratos, check out the side-by-side below.

Personally, I think the beard is a good look for the God of War, and he should definitely keep the eyebrows. This reminds me of seven years ago when I completely shaved off my beard for my wedding and my then fiance, now wife hated it. I’ve never clean-shaven since. I think Kratos ought to take that same advice, and I sincerely hope that the clean-shaven image isn’t concept art for a future game.

With or without the beard (but thankfully, it’s with) we gave God of War a perfect score along with myriad other outlets, and it is well-deserving of those accolades. There was also a brand new secret discovered using the map from the collector’s edition. After a lot of code breaking and the community coming together, a secret portal was found that grants the player a brand new axe pommel that increases all stats.

I prefer Kratos with a beard, but maybe some people here like him without?What do you think of clean-shaven Kratos? Would God of War be the same if Kratos was shouting “boy” without the face fuzz?

"There are several new changes in the eighth installment of SIE/Santa Monica Studios’ latest entry into the God of War franchise. The story leaves Greek mythology behind in favor of Norse mythology, populating the landscape with elves, trolls, and wolves, to name a few. Kratos’s signature double-chained blades,the Blades of Chaos, have been replaced with the Leviathan Axe. The game features a third-person, over-the-shoulder free camera this time around, along with open game play and NO camera cuts.

The biggest change however, is Kratos himself. No longer a rage-filled model of hyper masculinity, the latest installment features a kinder, gentler Ghost of Sparta, accompanied by his young son Atreus. Well, maybe not that kind and gentle; the dude is still a brutally lethal warrior who leaves fields of bodies in his wake. The new game takes place after the death of Kratos’ second wife and Atreus’ mother, and follows father and son as they journey to fulfill her promise and spread her ashes at the highest peak of the nine realms. Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus, who is also unaware of his true nature of being a god.

In an interview with Polygon, God of War director Cory Barlog discusses the evolution of the character, saying:

“It’s just, I feel like as I get older, I’m looking at things a little bit differently. This lesson that I hoped to pass on to [my son]: that the concepts of strength and emotional vulnerability and the ability to sort of be free to feel the range of emotions, that these are not two warring or diametrically opposed concepts. That it is what makes us the whole human, right? And who better to be a canvas than a person who is so broken, who is so much of a fragment of a person, whose life was so traumatic? At 8 years old, [Kratos was] entered into the most fearsome military training program in the history of mankind. The Spartans were turned into machines, instruments of war, and to have that be the way that you’re ushered into your formative years, it will absolutely turn you into what Kratos became. There’s very little humanity that he had left [after the previous God of War games], but I do not believe that anyone is so far gone that they don’t have some way to pull them back from the brink. I think it’s been a fantastic, dramatic chance to be able to take that on for Kratos.”

Kratos’s quest to rediscover his humanity and raise his son add a whole new level of dimensionality to the anti-hero, as he struggles to adjust to life as a single parent. Barlog goes on to discuss Kratos’s journey back to his own humanity, saying:

“So we are, in a large portion, were responsible for the fact that [Kratos] is the monster at all times, and now we are in turn taking our responsibility to help him balance these things. The journey is that he’s not very good at it in the beginning, and that’s what’s so fascinating, right? That a young kid, a 10- to 12-year-old child, can teach this guy who’s lived for hundreds of years? Who’s ascended to the throne of the pantheon of Greek gods, and been responsible for the downfall of so many of these deities. He has so much learning to do. Honestly, if that can be taken away, if people look at it and they can see there’s a complexity to being a human being … and also that there’s different ways [to behave], not just the way it’s been done before.”

The only way we can combat toxic masculinity is by upholding men and male characters not created in its image. It may be silly to credit a game like God of War for this, but I’ll take what I can get. The more nuanced, emotional male figures in gaming and pop culture, the better.

"Imagine you’re Kratos. You’ve got a son named Atreus, who you love very much, but you have to make sure he knows you’re also still the same old gruff man you’ve always been. What do you call him when you want his attention? Do you call him by his name? A nickname? No, you call him “Boy.” And you do it with reckless abandon.

If you haven’t yet been privy to the masterful sounds of Kratos calling Atreus “Boy” yet, then you’re in for a real treat. There’s a fantastic compilation on YouTube by TuYasRecords that puts together over an hour of Kratos calling out to his son. He says it in an angry tone. He says it in an inquisitive tone. He says it just about any way you can imagine that makes sense within the God of War universe. And this is free entertainment, people. You don’t even have to pay for it.

﻿

This hilarious video will have you getting in on the whole “Dad of Boy” craze that’s really tearing up the internet right now, as it should be. Kratos’s interactions with his son are some of the most touching and heartwarming moments throughout God of War, but as you can see they can also be abrupt and worth a giggle. Ah, awkward parenting skills. Where would we be without you?

"Jason Silva, the host of the show Brain Games, gave a talk yesterday at the Promax Games conference in San Francisco. In his best motivational voice, he spoke about how moments in life can inspire a sense of awe. Those moments can make you feel rapture, stupefied amazement, wonder, rapture, or ecstasy.

“We reconfigure out mental models of the world,” he said.

When you feel a moment of awe, you are fully engaged with that moment. Silva said he had that feeling when he played Assassin’s Creed Origins, because Ubisoft had built such a faithful and full re-creation of ancient Egypt in its latest video game. And I felt that sense of awe when I played God of War, in a moment near the beginning where Kratos, the God of War, tries but fails to comfort his son.

Image Credit: Promax Games

His son shoots a deer, but it is only wounded. Kratos directs the boy, Atreus, to kill the deer with his knife. The boy can’t bring himself to do it. Kratos guides his hand with the knife and they do it together. The camera pulls back behind the two of them.

The boy looks out into the distance. Kratos brings up his hand as if to give the boy a hug. But he can’t bring himself to wrap his hand around the boy’s shoulder. He is, after all, the God of War, and not some mushy modern dad. He says, “Now you are ready.”

His son replies, “For what?”

“A new beginning,” Kratos replies. Just then, an enormous dragon flies from the mountain the distance and rears up just before Kratos and Atreus. And then it flies on. I could almost feel the wind from the flapping wings.

That moment created a sense of awe for me because it was such a touching part of a video game, which is something that I did not always associate with the highest form of dramatic art.

Image Credit: Sony

And it was memorable to me because, as I remember, my own father, who died about 20 years ago this week, showed me the same kind of tough love when I was growing up. Sometimes, a scene in a video game moves us because of what we personally bring to that game as we play it. As I played this game, I saw that Kratos had changed from his past. He had become the kind of father that I had known. I could identify with little Atreus, even though my father never took me out to fight demons.

Sony’s reboot of the God of War franchise took nearly seven years to bring to fruition, and it recasts Kratos as a father who has to care for a son who isn’t really anything like him. He has to teach Atreus to survive in a dangerous world, and he certainly doesn’t want to coddle the boy, whom he refers to as “boy” in the beginning of the game. He tells the boy, “Don’t be sorry. Be better.” The narrative slows down the action, and it forces you to focus on the relationship between son and father. Much of the dialogue happens as the two row boats together.

Kratos, a god of Greek mythology, has left his past behind him and moved into the lands of the Norse, where a new set of gods rules. He tries to lay low, but the Norse gods find him and challenge him. He goes on a journey to a mountain and has to protect his son along the way. When Kratos gets in intense battles with his magical axe, he doesn’t have to worry only about beating the enemy. He also has to make sure that has son lives.

Kratos trains Atreus in combat, but the fragile Atreus proves himself. Not only with the bow, which distracts Kratos’ enemies. But he can also read Norse runes and messages that Kratos cannot. In that way, the father becomes dependent on the sickly son. It was a bit weird to revisit Norse mythology again so soon after playing Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, but it was so well done in both games. Grudgingly, Kratos learns to praise his son for getting them out of tough situations. Fortunately, Atreus eventually becomes an asset during combat.

Image Credit: GamesBeat

A few other moments caused me to think about my own dad during the game. Like Kratos, my father lightened up as I got older. As I earned his respect, he bestowed praise. Late in the game, Kratos can share a light moment with his son, and almost let loose a burst of laughter.

This game had many more moments of awe, where I could breathe in the world and feel like I was in another place, another life. The home of the witch comes alive with color. The Lake of the Nine is an epic landscape. The enemies are increasingly challenging, until you feel like you’re not just fighting underlings but you are really fighting gods.

It’s early in 2018, but I’m pretty sure this will be one of the best games that I play this year. It’s a rare case where the hyperbole of a game designer — in this case, Cory Barlog, when I interviewed him last year — completely lived up to the real thing. It’s all because they slowed down the pace of the game, gave it a real story with better characters, and preserved the essence of the gameplay that previous God of War games dwelled upon. I have never been to the places I saw in God of War, but it brought back memories.",tech,https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/27/the-deanbeat-god-of-war-can-fill-you-with-a-sense-of-awe/

"Soon the sun sets on Season 3.

The constant failure that comes with playing Fortnite wouldn't be nearly as appetizing without some incentive for playing aside from winning. Epic's seasonal structure remedies this a bit, introducing challenges with cool cosmetic rewards for playing the game in all sorts of ways, and Fortnite Season 4 will surely evolve the formula. Changes to the map, weapons, and theme are on the way too, but the extent of those changes is still a mystery. Epic has been dropping in-game clues for while though, so here's what we know (and think we know) about Fortnite Season 4 so far.

When does Fortnite Season 4 start?

While we don't know for sure, Season 3 is set to end on April 30. Epic has also been releasing cryptic promotional material (which we'll cover below) nearly every day now, so it's a safe bet that we'll at least know when Season 4 starts on April 30, or that it will begin the moment Season 3 closes, likely May 1.

How much will the Battle Pass cost?

With each season comes a new Battle Pass, a paid-for package that gives players access to weekly challenges and dozens of cosmetic rewards for completing them. While Epic hasn't announced a price yet, we'd bet on 950 V-Bucks (approximately $10) like Season 3, but given how new Battle Royale is, anything is subject to change between seasons.

What will Fortnite Season 4's theme be?

After Season 3's space theme gave us one astronaut skin after another, including the fish-headed Leviathan skin, Season 4 is coming back to earth with what appear to be superheroes (and villains, we're guessing) in tow. Recent tweets from the official Fortnite Twitter account show a cartoon comet broken into a few sections, with a new character filled in each day. Two characters have appeared so far, both wearing what appears to be superhero head garb, accompanied by some flavor text that would sound pretty natural coming out of a superhero's mouth.

Fight with Honor.Season 4 Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/75XrH6EYamApril 27, 2018

A possible leaker with an unnamed source posted alleged Season 4 details to the Fortnite Battle Royale subreddit a few days before the tweets, accurately predicting the superhero theme. We'll supposedly see some superhero and supervillain skins available in the store and/or Battle Pass that won't be based on any existing superhero properties but will instead be of Epic's creation, which feels pretty obvious now. This is pure speculation based on an unverified source with a 1-for-1 track record, so if it's off don't be surprised.

Season 3 saw the western half of the map heavily revamped, so if Season 4 left the eastern half untouched, we'd be very disappointed. There are some lingering issues caused as a side effect from the lopsided map update to address, too. Some areas like Titled Towers pull in significant portions of the player population right off the bat almost every match, leaving the rest of the map a bit too wanting for action.

Teases leading up to Fortnite Season 4 have some players thinking Titled Towers is going to be eradicated by an incoming comet that appeared in the sky a few weeks back, but I'd wager it's either going to be moved, or a different area will get obliterated and made over. Destroying Titled won't make the less popular places that much more appealing, so expect a bigger, ongoing map makeover this season.

The Reddit leaker also alleges that a meteor will obliterate Dusty Depot instead of Titled Towers, and that the map will be constantly evolving throughout the season, ending with the eventual removal of Moisty Mire. I desperately want to believe it's true, and it makes sense based on what needs the most attention, but again, take these 'leaks' with a grain of salt for now.

Hard to say. Epic adds new weapons all the time and building out the arsenal seemed like a major focus in Season 3. But more weapons isn't what Fortnite needs right now. The map needs some major love, and the existing weapons need some fine-tuning. Expect to see a couple more over the course of Season 4, maybe tied to the theme, but don't expect the same cadence we saw in Season 3.

How long will Fortnite Season 4 last?

Season 3 is scheduled for 10 weeks, so expect a similar length for Season 4. Again, Epic is continually tweaking every appendage of Fortnite, so nothing is set in stone. Season 4 could be only two months long, or it could last for a decade. We'll know soon enough.",tech,https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-season-4-battle-pass/

After Season 3's space theme gave us one astronaut skin after another, including the fish-headed Leviathan skin, Season 4 is coming back to earth with what appear to be superheroes (and villains, we're guessing) in tow. Recent tweets from the official Fortnite Twitter account show a cartoon comet broken into a few sections, with a new character filled in each day. Two characters have appeared so far, both wearing what appears to be superhero head garb, accompanied by some flavor text that would sound pretty natural coming out of a superhero's mouth.

Fight with Honor.Season 4 Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/75XrH6EYamApril 27, 2018

A possible leaker with an unnamed source posted alleged Season 4 details to the Fortnite Battle Royale subreddit a few days before the tweets, accurately predicting the superhero theme. We'll supposedly see some superhero and supervillain skins available in the store and/or Battle Pass that won't be based on any existing superhero properties but will instead be of Epic's creation, which feels pretty obvious now. This is pure speculation based on an unverified source with a 1-for-1 track record, so if it's off don't be surprised.

Season 3 saw the western half of the map heavily revamped, so if Season 4 left the eastern half untouched, we'd be very disappointed. There are some lingering issues caused as a side effect from the lopsided map update to address, too. Some areas like Titled Towers pull in significant portions of the player population right off the bat almost every match, leaving the rest of the map a bit too wanting for action.

Teases leading up to Fortnite Season 4 have some players thinking Titled Towers is going to be eradicated by an incoming comet that appeared in the sky a few weeks back, but I'd wager it's either going to be moved, or a different area will get obliterated and made over. Destroying Titled won't make the less popular places that much more appealing, so expect a bigger, ongoing map makeover this season.

The Reddit leaker also alleges that a meteor will obliterate Dusty Depot instead of Titled Towers, and that the map will be constantly evolving throughout the season, ending with the eventual removal of Moisty Mire. I desperately want to believe it's true, and it makes sense based on what needs the most attention, but again, take these 'leaks' with a grain of salt for now.

Hard to say. Epic adds new weapons all the time and building out the arsenal seemed like a major focus in Season 3. But more weapons isn't what Fortnite needs right now. The map needs some major love, and the existing weapons need some fine-tuning. Expect to see a couple more over the course of Season 4, maybe tied to the theme, but don't expect the same cadence we saw in Season 3.

How long will Fortnite Season 4 last?

Season 3 is scheduled for 10 weeks, so expect a similar length for Season 4. Again, Epic is continually tweaking every appendage of Fortnite, so nothing is set in stone. Season 4 could be only two months long, or it could last for a decade. We'll know soon enough.",tech,https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-season-4-battle-pass/
"Epic

It’s weird to give a spoiler warning when it comes to Fortnite, but in this case, it may be appropriate, if you don’t want to know what Epic has planned for season 4’s debut.

While I will always take reddit-based rumors with a grain of salt, a user named internetadam posted several days ago that Fortnite’s season 4 theme would be superheroes, before that was revealed in a teaser image Epic posted yesterday.

Now he’s back with some more predictions, and they have to do with both the target of the comet and the superhero theme:

Reportedly the comet’s target is Dusty Depot, not Tilted Towers, which means the most complex area on the map might be safe.

Reportedly Epic wants the map to evolve more often. They thought it would have been better if Tilted Towers had gone up a building or two at a time, rather than all at once.

Moisty Mire should be gone and replaced with something else by the end of season 4.

As previously said, the theme of season 4 is superheroes, and there will be at least two hero and villain skins. These are original characters of Epic’s own creating, not established heroes.

Do I buy it?

Epic

For the most part, I’d say yes. Not just because the superhero prediction turned out right, but because a lot of this seems pretty plausible. In my view:

It makes more sense to nuke an area like Dusty Depot that people may not care all that much about, as opposed to Tilted, which is the most iconic/played-in zone of the map.

I can also believe that Epic wants the map to evolve more often than every season, given that they have the power to do that with their tools. I think they saw how much people have liked seeing things like the comet’s evolution, and they realize they could do that with map additions as well, just like they add in new weapons and items each week. Slowly build out the map rather than have new zones arrive in giant chunks. Make people guess about what’s coming. It makes sense.

Moisty Mire is the worst and deserves to be replaced, so if any zone is going to get cut, it’s a safe bet it’s this one.

This could just be an educated guess after the two superheroes showed up in the teaser image, but it makes sense. I also think it’s a good idea for Epic to create their own Fortnite-branded heroes rather than do something like “Captain USA” or “Uberman.”

We will know how this pans out in a few days, and then we can fact check these claims against what already happens. They sound plausible enough, but I’ve been doing this long enough where I know it pays to be skeptical.

"A new Fortnite challenges update has arrived, unlocking Week 10 objectives for Battle Pass owners on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and mobile. This is the final week of Season 3, and it introduces a new element--floating rings to skydive through--along with a search for an object between a stone circle, wooden bridge, and red RV that may prove difficult for some.

As always, there is a total of seven challenges in all. Some of these are things you'd do anyway; one of the hard objectives is to eliminate 10 opponents. You may be best off doing that in the Solo playlist, where you don't have to worry about revives or teammates taking your kills. You may want to head to Pleasant Park to do that, as another hard objective asks for three eliminations in Pleasant Park; complete each of those for 10 Battle Stars.

The trickiest of Week 10's challenges is the aforementioned ""search between"" one. Like those in the past, this simply requires you to reach a location between three vaguely described objects and pick up an item. Unless you're especially familiar with the map, you may not know the location based on he name--the game tells you to search between a Stone Circle, Wooden Bridge, and a Red RV. This is just southeast of Tomato Town, near the southwestern edge of Wailing Woods (in the H4 section, as seen in the map below). You'll find a circle of stones with a log in the middle, and the Battle Star to collect will be hovering over that.

As for the objective telling you to skydive through floating rings, you'll see these as soon as the Battle Bus begins making its way across the island. There are purple ones at higher elevations and blue ones closer to the ground. You'll need to go through a total of 10, and both the purple and blue rings count for one. This will take multiple matches to complete, as you'll want to try to hit at least two as you jump from the Battle Bus. Despite what the challenge says, you don't specifically have to be skydiving--you can gently make your way through with the glider equipped to ensure you don't miss a ring.

The remainder of the challenges mostly involve spending time in the right places. You'll need to search chests in Fatal Fields, as well as search chests in different named locations. For the latter, just bring up the map and keep track of each place you open a chest. The Fatal Fields chest will count for one, and from there you can make your way to any other area with a name to find a chest. Finally, you'll need to deal a total of 250 headshot damage to enemies. If you're a good sniper, that's going to be your best bet for handling this quickly, but any gun will do.

You can see the full list of Week 10 challenges below, or consult our full list of Season 3 challenges. Week 10 is the final leg of Season 3, and it looks as if things may be coming to a head with Fortnite's meteor and alien theories. But you still have some time to complete these objectives and any you haven't already done--that'll help you to level up your Battle Pass more quickly and earn the skins and rewards currently up for grabs.

"Smartphone shipments in China have dropped by 21 percent in Q1 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017, as per the latest data shared by market analyst firm Canalys. According to the report, the total number of smartphone shipments in the country in the first quarter totalled 91 million - a number that the market had passed back in Q4 2013. In Q1 last year, the number was reported to be 114 million units. The year-on-year drop is being called the biggest ever decline in smartphone shipments in China.

As per the Canalys report, eight out of the top 10 smartphone vendors in China were hit by annual declines. Companies like Gionee, Meizu, and Samsung have declined to less than half of their respective Q1 2017 numbers. Meanwhile, Huawei, including sub-brand Honor, has seen a minor 2 percent growth in shipment. However, it is still maintaining its position at the top with 24 percent market share.

Meanwhile, Oppo and Vivo have seen a decline in shipments by 10 percent to 18 million and 15 million respectively. However, ""Xiaomi was the only company to buck the trend,"" the report claims, with its smartphone shipments growing 37 percent year-on-year to 12 million units. Interestingly, it has overtaken Apple to take the fourth position.

Notably, the total market share for mobile makers outside the top five fell from 34 percent in Q1 last year to 19 percent this quarter. Gionee bore the most brunt, with shipments down by about 70 percent. Canalys researchers claim that despite healthy competition amongst the top manufacturers, there is a sense of fatigue in the Chinese market. Research Analyst Mo Jia says, ""The level of competition has forced every vendor to imitate the others' product portfolios and go-to-market strategies. But the costs of marketing and channel management in a country as big as China are huge, and only vendors that have reached a certain size can cope.""

For Xiaomi, the growth is in line with its progress overseas. It is the only company in the list that focusses on the sub sub-CNY 1,000 (roughly Rs. 10,500) handsets. However, another analyst claimed that the company is trying hard to shed its low-cost image. ""The launch of the Mi Mix 2S in Paris and the very recent Mi 6X in Wuhan are clear efforts by the company to change customers' perception of the brand, especially in China, where Xiaomi needs to tempt those looking at Honor, Oppo or Vivo to buy its products,"" an analyst said.

"Smartphone shipments in China suffered their biggest ever decline in Q1 2018, down by more than 21% annually to 91 million units, a number first passed some four years ago in Q4 2013. Eight of the top 10 smartphone vendors were hit by annual declines, with Gionee, Meizu and Samsung shrinking to less than half of their respective Q1 2017 numbers. Huawei (including Honor) managed to grow shipments by a modest 2%, maintaining its lead and consolidating its market share to about 24% by shipping over 21 million smartphones. Second-placed Oppo and third-placed Vivo bore the brunt of the overall decline, with shipments falling by about 10% to 18 million and 15 million respectively. Xiaomi was the only company to buck the trend, growing shipments by 37% to 12 million units, and overtaking Apple to take fourth place.

The top four vendors, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, together accounted for more than 73% of shipments in China in Q1 2018. And despite healthy competition, there is a sense of fatigue in the market. “The level of competition has forced every vendor to imitate the others’ product portfolios and go-to-market strategies,” said Canalys Research Analyst Mo Jia. “But the costs of marketing and channel management in a country as big as China are huge, and only vendors that have reached a certain size can cope. While Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi must contend with a shrinking Chinese market, they can take comfort from the fact that it will continue to consolidate, and that their size will help them last longer than other smaller players.”

Xiaomi once again grew against the market, owing in part to a lackluster 2017. Nonetheless, the growth is noteworthy given the pace at which Xiaomi is also growing overseas. “Xiaomi is the only vendor in the top-5 that is focused on the sub-RMB1,000 (about US$160) price segment and it owes close to 90% of its shipments to Redmi. But the vendor is struggling to shed its low-cost image,” said Canalys Research Analyst Hattie He. “The launch of the Mi Mix 2S in Paris and the very recent Mi 6X in Wuhan are clear efforts by the company to change customers’ perception of the brand, especially in China, where Xiaomi needs to tempt those looking at Honor, Oppo or Vivo to buy its products.”

The total market share for vendors outside the top five fell from 34% in Q1 2017 to 19% this quarter. Gionee suffered the worst decline, with shipments down by about 70% to 1.6 million.

After successive falls in the last two quarters, China is expected to return to growth in Q2, as Oppo, Vivo and Huawei launch new flagship devices and hope to excite the market once again. “The inventory issues that Oppo and Vivo suffered in Q4 and Q1 are now behind them,” said Jia. “New smartphones will definitely entice people to upgrade, but vendors are more careful of avoiding oversupply in the channel. China’s smartphone market may see a short period of stagnancy as vendors refocus on research and development, relying on new use cases to excite refreshes rather than spending heavily on the channel and marketing.”

"China, the world’s largest smartphone market, saw handset shipments suffer their biggest decline ever during the last quarter, according to a new report from market research firm Canalys.

Compared to the same period last year, shipments were down 21 percent during the first three months of the year, with Chinese consumers buying 91 million devices. Q1 2018 was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2013 that shipments failed to reach or pass 100 million units.

While a decline had been expected, analysts were surprised by its size. “Eight of the top 10 smartphone vendors were hit by annual declines, with Gionee, Meizu and Samsung shrinking to less than half of their respective Q1 2017 numbers,” the report read.

The reason behind the slump could be something we're familiar with in the West: a lack of variation among new phones and too many ad campaigns. “The level of competition has forced every vendor to imitate the others’ product portfolios and go-to-market strategies,” said Canalys research analyst Mo Jia

Despite posting yet another record quarter, Samsung has issued warnings about a stagnating smartphone market. It sold just 2 million devices in China during Q1. Apple also struggled, falling down to fifth place in terms of total number of shipments. The top four companies— Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi—made up 73 percent of all shipments in the country for the quarter.

Xiaomi, which overtook Apple into fourth place, was one of the brighter spots. Its shipments were up 37 percent YoY to 12 million units, though supply problems did mean it had a poor Q1 2017. Huawei, the top phone company in China, also grew, albeit by only 2 percent.

Canalys predicts that the second quarter of the year will see growth, thanks to new flagships from Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei, but believes there will be an overall decline during 2018.",tech,https://www.techspot.com/news/74352-china-smartphone-market-sees-biggest-slump-five-years.html

But Apple could launch new features along the way.",tech,https://www.ibtimes.co.in/apple-ios-11-3-1-fixes-annoying-unresponsive-display-issue-post-third-party-repairs-767879
"Apple iOS 11.3 left users in a hole. Serious problems (1,2,3,4,5) undermined its important new features and put Apple under pressure to deliver solutions with iOS 11.3.1. Unfortunately, iOS 11.3.1 fails at that task. Furthermore, it also contains a truly nasty surprise…

‘Great Secret Features’ and ‘Nasty Surprises’ are my regular columns investigating the best features / biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.

While iOS 11.3.1 delivers only one solitary fix when many more were needed, the real problem is it’s actually carrying over the most serious bug introduced by iOS 11.3. So if you think you were clever skipping straight to iOS 11.3.1, think again.

This high profile problem, dubbed ‘audio skipping’, distorts and skips sound during music playback, podcasts and even when making phone and FaceTime calls. Often making these features almost unusable.

The reaction to this on social media has been vitriolic, with the official @AppleSupport account bearing the brunt of it. Here are some examples:

“@AppleSupport need to get a fix for 11.3.1 ASAP. Can’t listen to music/podcasts without the now famous skipping issue. Trying to persist with this iPhone 6 but am getting increasingly tempted to make the switch to Samsung after 10+ years of Apple phones @Apple” - source

“@AppleSupport iOS 11.3.1 drops audio in the middle of my calls. I’ve also experienced lag more than 11.3. My battery’s fine, before you ask.” - source

“@AppleSupport music and podcast playback periodically interrupted by faltering music or speech as though words are being very quickly repeated. Any ideas if this is a common fault or what solution maybe? Occurring on Deezer and podcast apps.” - source

“F***in @Apple’s #IOS113, apparently i’m not the only one with the music crackle, pops, jitter, regardless of the app i use.” - source

“@AppleSupport Yes, 11.3.1. I was on a call and the sound began skipping. I hung up thinking it was my connection, but alas, it won't make any calls or receive now.“ - source

“Hi @AppleSupport - Since updating my iPhone 6s to iOS 11.3.1 last week, music and podcasts began skipping and stuttering immediately afterwards.” - source

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this, however, is the claim Apple is telling users iOS 11.3.1 secretly fixes this problem. Something that will only lead to more unsuspecting users installing it and finding their devices are now impacted.

From my investigations, I’ve seen no evidence of a fix. I have read that some users have found a workaround where they do a hard reset of their iPhones using iTunes, but that’s not a proper fix by any means. I have reached out to Apple for a reply on this and will update when/if I get a reply.

Until then, once again, I’m sorry to say my recommendation is to steer clear of iOS 11.3.1.

This is a shame. Optimistically, I had said in my Upgrade Guide that any user affected by the bugs in iOS 11.3 had nothing to lose moving to iOS 11.3.1. That’s no longer true…

"If you own an iPhone, you should be concerned about GrayKey. That's the name for a new kind of device that's becoming increasingly popular with law enforcement agencies across the U.S., according to recent reports. It's popular because it unlocks iPhones protected with a passcode, even ones running Apple's most recent software, iOS 11.

GrayKey is the product of Grayshift, a security company based in Atlanta that was co-founded by an ex-Apple security engineer. The device itself is a nondescript black box with two Lightning cables sticking out. But once you connect a locked iPhone, it can somehow bypass Apple's built-in protections against repeatedly attempting to guess the phone's passcode — effectively letting users ""brute force"" the code and get in after a certain amount of tries. A four-digit code becomes practically useless, and a six-digit code might take a few days to crack at the most.

SEE ALSO: How Your iPhone's Screen Actually Works

Phone-cracking technology has been around since people started keeping sensitive information on phones, but in recent years the security pendulum swung hard in the direction of the user, with improved encryption techniques and widespread adoption of it by Apple, Google, and other big tech companies. As a result, law enforcement decried the emergence of ""warrant-proof"" devices and complained that important communications were now inaccessible, resulting in intelligence gathering ""going dark.""

With GrayKey, it definitely looks like the pendulum is swinging the other way. Thanks to the reporting of Motherboard journalist Joseph Cox, we know that local law enforcement across the country are buying the device, which costs as little as $15,000 (plus a subscription to Grayshift's service) — expensive to the individual, but to a police department, much less than a single squad car. Federal agencies are looking to procure the device, too.

Cox joined the MashTalk podcast this week to discuss GrayKey, how it works, and the implications of it in the ongoing tug of war between digital security advocates and law enforcement. Joseph Hall, the chief technologist of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington, D.C.-based group that advocates for civil liberties around digital issues, also guest stars to break down what this could mean for technology policy.

One of the first questions we tackle is whether or not GrayKey is actually a good thing? If it's only used when cops have a legitimate warrant to search the contents of an iPhone, doesn't that restore the status quo pre-encryption and ensure they can get the evidence they need to catch criminals?

That may be true, but Hall points out that clearly GrayKey takes advantage of some heretofore unknown exploit, which could be leveraged by other parties. And even if others don't discover the flaw, there's not much stopping oppressive regimes, banks, or anyone else with $15,000 to burn from procuring one of these boxes, too.

""We have no indication that Grayshift is going to sell these devices only to U.S. law enforcement,"" said Hall. ""They, like any other business that does this, have to ask themselves: How far is too far? What regime is too antithetical to your own principle that you won't sell the devices to?""

That would have grave implications for device privacy worldwide. Still, there's hope. As Cox says, the emergence of GrayKey (and other technologies like Cellebrite) means the balance between hacking devices and securing them has shifted, but that doesn't mean it won't shift back. Apple almost certainly has one of these boxes, Cox says, and surely a future iPhone or version of iOS will have better defenses against them.

""Eventually when it does get fixed, because presumably it will, there will be another lull,"" Cox said. ""There will be a point where the hackers are trying to catch up again.""

But does GrayKey betray the existence of a larger problem that needs solving? Just this week the infamous case that pitted Apple against the FBI two years ago was back in the news when research by former Microsoft Chief Technical Officer Ray Ozzie was highlighted in Backchannel: a way for iPhones to have an extra set of encryption keys, stored securely at Apple HQ, and only accessible with a valid warrant on a specific device.

It's essentially the backdoor into iPhones law enforcement has been asking for, but it's likely untenable. Ozzie's proposal was eviscerated by the infosec community, and Hall dismisses it as old news.

""Having mandates in the laws to have backdoors is just a really bad idea,"" said Hall. ""We know that these devices have flaws, both hardware and software flaws, so use those to find the way. It's not going to be like a light switch — you can't just turn it on and collect content willy-nilly... it's more something where you develop a capability, and you cultivate that ability. And when you can't do it internally, you may have to rely on the market. In that sense, it's good.""

As uncomfortable as it may be to face, the security arms race between Big Tech and law enforcement may be the worst solution — except for all the other ones.",tech,https://mashable.com/2018/04/27/graykey-unlock-iphone-mashtalk/
"Apple released iOS 11.3.1 update with fix for third-party display repairs yesterday. The update brought fix to an issue reported after the release of iOS 11.3 where consumers complained the displays repaired by third-party dealers stopped working after installation of the update. While the release of iOS 11.3.1 fixes a known bug, it still fails to fix an older issue.

According to Forbes, the update does not bring fix to an older problem dubbed as audio skipping. The issue reportedly distorts and skips sound during music playback, podcasts and even while making phone and FaceTime calls. The iOS 11.3 users claim the problem is so grave that it makes some of these applications almost unusable. Most iPhone users have been found tweeting directly at @AppleSupport handle.

There are even claims that Apple is telling users iOS 11.3.1 update secretly fixes this problem. It is not clear whether the update indeed fixes these known issues but the changelog for iOS 11.3.1 does not include any official mention of this issue. Some iPhone users are also noting that a hard reset using iTunes does fix this issue but it is not a proven or proper fix. Apple is yet to comment whether it knows of this issue and when it issue a formal fix for the audio problem.

Apple is expected to unveil iOS 12, the next major update to iOS at WWDC in June. The reports suggest the new version of iOS won’t a lot of big ticket features and Apple is instead focusing on improving overall usability and stability of its mobile operating system. There are also reports that Apple is more focused on bringing major system level improvements and security enhancements this time as opposed to major consumer facing features.

Axios had reported that Apple is planning to not release all major features at one go with the launch of iOS 12 at WWDC in June. It rather plans to release some elements of iOS 12 features as part of consequent updates. The move is aimed to water down some of the known issues with major release in the past. Despite issues and bug fixes, the adoption of iOS 11 has reached 76 percent, which is way better than the Android camp.",tech,http://www.bgr.in/news/apple-ios-11-3-1-fixes-display-issue-iphone-ipad-audio-skipping-bug-still-not-fixed/
"Shakti Kapoor says Shraddha Kapoor will marry a man of her own choice. Shakti Kapoor says Shraddha Kapoor will marry a man of her own choice.

Actor Shakti Kapoor says his daughter and actress Shraddha Kapoor will marry a man of her own choice. Shakti spoke to the media at a teaser and poster launch of his upcoming film The Journey of Karma here on Thursday.

Asked about Shraddha’s wedding plans, Shakti said: “Every father wants that his daughter to get married in a good and respected family. I wish that she grows in her personal and professional life, but I think as a parent, you have to give some kind of liberty to your children because now that period is gone when parents used to marry their children (to a person) of their choice.

“Now, we have to ask them about their choices in terms of everything, including their life partners. She is right now very busy in her career, but whenever she will tell us about her marriage plans, she will marry a man of her own choice and we don’t have any objection with that.”

As a father, Shakti is happy that Shraddha, who will next be seen in Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal’s biopic, is working hard to take on challenging roles. “In today’s time, every actor is taking challenges in his career. If you see actors right from Ranbir Kapoor and Farhan Akhtar, all are doing really good in biopics in which they have worked. Every actor is working hard in the film industry.

“Now Shraddha will play the character of Saina Nehwal. She has trained with Saina in Hyderabad and now, she is continuing her training. Apart from that, she will also head to Abu Dhabi to shoot for ‘Saaho’ along with Prabhas. She is also working with Rajkummar Rao in ‘Stree’ and ‘Batti Gul Meter Chalu’… So, I am really happy that she is working in every genre of films at this point in her career.”

On his own journey in the film industry, Shakti said: “My journey in film industry has been really good and children are also doing really well in their life. I think God has been really kind and it is also blessing of the audience.”

Shakti, who is also close to the Dutt family, is happy to see the teaser of Rajkumar Hirani’s Sanju, starring Ranbir.

He said: “I think the teaser of ‘Sanju’ is extraordinary. I think it’s one of the finest teasers that I have seen. Ranbir Kapoor is looking and acting crazily close to Sanjay Dutt in the teaser. My real name is Sunil Kapoor but Mr. Sunil Dutt named me Shakti Kapoor. So, I am close to Dutt family.”

"Shraddha Kapoor's relationship status has always been something of a question mark. While she has been linked with several of her co-stars, from Farhan Akhtar to Aditya Roy Kapur, she has never admitted to being in a relationship with any of them. At a recent event, her father Shakti Kapoor was asked about her marriage plans, and he was quite candid.

""Every father wants that his daughter to get married in a good and respected family,"" Shakti said, adding that the era of parents choosing a partner for their children was long gone.

The Andaz Apna Apna actor went on to add, ""Now, we have to ask them about their choices in terms of everything, including their life partners. She is right now very busy in her career, but whenever she will tell us about her marriage plans, she will marry a man of her own choice and we don't have any objection with that.""

"It was Oye Lucky Oye which proved Abhay Deol as a non-conformist actor who engages with the craft of cinema at every level. Though the actor has come far, the description of a rebel actor is still apt for him. “The rebel in me is not just still there but it’s growing. Just because I am settled in other aspects of my life, my desire to raise the bar and go beyond the mainstream narrative has not died. My belief that the non-formula films can also work has not diminished,” asserts the actor who was in Capital recently to talk about his latest release, Naanu Ki Jaanu. The film might not have set the box office on fire but the horror-comedy again ticked the ‘experimental’ tag that is associated with Abhay.

Abhay’s seemingly bold choices with films like Dev D, Manorama Six Feet Under and Road, Movie proved successful but as the multiplex became the new default exhibition space, according to him, the surge in experimentation did not continue with as much vigour as it was earlier. “At that time, multiplexes, as exhibition spaces, needed different genres of work to exhibit and we got lucky that time with those films,” he remembers.

Along with his unique gaze, his boyish tone is one of the attributes that define his on-screen persona. Does he want to remain in a niche space? “For the industry, it is important to put people in boxes. I don’t feel that way but yes my choices can be niche and when you are not following the mainstream, you automatically create a niche for yourself. The industry experts may say that I have a niche audience but I have no intentions as such,” remarks Abhay. Be it Raanjhanaa, Zindagi Milegi Na Dobara or the recent Happy Bhaag Jayegi, he reminds, that he has been a part of many mainstream ensembles. “But films in my kitty are as usual less,” he smiles.

He does not want to be choosy all the time but, according to him, his non-conformist approach stops him from entering the formulaic space. This doesn’t worry him either. “I have privileges and a secure life and I am thankful for everything. I am trying to give back by pursuing the projects that I like more diligently,” says Abhay. During breaks between films, he pursues a routine life. “It is my choice of life. Maybe, I am older now and with age comes the desire to have a routine life,” opines the actor. “When I am not working, I try to develop stories and script ideas which keep me engaged. I travel a lot and it gives me an opportunity to observe people,” he adds.

Though cinema is very dear to him, he hardly keeps a check on the kinds of films that are releasing these days. “I have only watched Shape of Water in last few months but I am sure there is more support for new writers and directors. But filmmakers have to realise that they have to raise the bar because they are competing with content from around the world and there far more platforms for entertainment than ever before. When formula films are dooming a lot more often at the box office, there is no guarantee of anything now,” quips Abhay.

His desire to make the so called off beat films mainstream keeps him going and he is optimistic in this regard. “It may not happen during my career span but the efforts of many artists can make this happen. Studios around the world are only interested in making money and they have no bone of creativity. But one has to understand that the creative part of the game cannot be sidetracked because of money,” sums up Abhay.",entertainment,http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/in-search-of-an-alternative/article23694346.ece
"Avengers Infinity War hit the screens this week, and Indian fans have been in a tizzy. The craze for advance bookings reached such a pitch that several shows were sold out within minutes.

Considering Hollywood doesn't have such a solid footing in Indian markets, the star-studded superhero film is all set to smash previous records.

Avengers Infinity War has made Rs 29 crore in the advance bookings alone. And, it doesn't stop there.

Trade analysts expect the film to make around Rs 20 crore on the first day itself. The figures are expected to go higher, as there were ticket counter purchases as well.

Avengers Infinity War has beaten Bollywood in its own backyard, by racing ahead of blockbusters like Dangal and Tiger Zinda Hai, despite releasing in only 2000 screens. Compare this to Aamir Khan's film, which was released in over 4000 screens, just like Salman Khan's film. Dangal earned Rs 29.78 crore on its first day, and Salman's Tiger Zinda Hai made Rs 33.75 crore.

His previous venture, Tubelight, made only Rs 20. 75 crore on the first day. Tiger Shroff's much-awaited action packed Baaghi 2 made Rs 25 crore.

The previous Avengers film, Age of Ultron, is the highest grossing superhero Hollywood film till date, as it made Rs 77 crore.

Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Avengers Infinity War with a star cast including Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo, tells the tale of Marvel's best superheroes, who have to unite and save the world from the villain Thanos, who is on a mission to gain all six infinity stones. If he lays his hands on all six, he can annihilate half the world with just a snap of his fingers.

"Halfway or somewhere after the middle section -- we can't tell because the interval is forced into the drama -- the characters of the Avengers franchise, all well-known and beloved characters, converge on Wakanda the imaginary African country where the last big Marvel film ""The Black Panther"" unfolded.

That is the cue for a big battle -- the battles in these comic book adaptations are never bloody never indigestible, always miraculously sanitised and pristine. The battles are relentless, and yet fascinating in their aversion to actual bloodshed. In the first quarter of the sprawling saga, we see New York is devastated by the super-villain Thanos(played with unnerving splendour by Josh Brolin).

The lengthy sequence of plundered skyscrapers and wrecked cars is humorised by the super-heroes who one after the other, pop up from the sky challenging Thanos.

We know from the outset what the super-heroes probably don't. Thanos is a more formidable enemy than any that the super-hero films have faced in the past. He is learned, scholarly, philosophical and suave. And he truly believes that destroying half of civilization is the only way to preserve the other half .

Thanos is probably the most compelling and persuasive super-villain I've seen in the Marvel series. A true descendant of Raavan, his erudite pragmatic approach to violence is compelling. His dialogues with his adoptive daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldana) are the emotional highlights of the narrative, creative undulating rhythms into what is otherwise a straight-and-narrow configuration of assembly line super-heroics.

Very often as I sat through the elaborate set-pieces, shot with the painstaking preening and posturing of a super-model who knows she will set the ramp on fire come what may, I felt I was watching a film that tries too hard to justify the coming together of the mighty powers that make the heroism of the comic book realm look fashionably mottled and majestic.

The dialogues among the Big-Boy-Heroes are of the kind that we hear in high-school plays where pre-pubescent boys with false moustaches play a bantering game to a battered finale. Except for Mark Ruffalo's shaken-and-dithering Hulk, not one of the actors playing the patented parts get a chance to have their say in any definitive way. They all saunter in and out barely getting a few minutes of me-too-time before the co-directors scurry back to the arching intellectualised villainy of Thanos.

Parts of the film are fun to watch provided you don't question why the super-heroes don't harness their collective energies into defeating the unconquerable villain. Come to think of it, Josh Brolin's Thanos is not a villain. Not really. Not when his heart beats to a distant drum of humanism even while dreaming of destroying half of civilization.

The biggest problem with this excessively zealous super-hero film is its finale. So arrogant in its defeatist tone, so definite in its defeatism I wondered why the film's scriptwriters bothered with the buildup to a suitably grand climax when all along the film favoured a whimper over a hurrah.

Say what you will, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a gravely lopsided topheavy work with superstars waltzing in and out sometimes barely getting a few minutes of playing time. This is specially true of the female actors. A star like Gwyneth Paltrow playing Ironman Robert Downey Jr's Significant Other barely gets a chance to prove her significance.

'Avengers: Infinity War' is the kind of cinema that treats its epic intentions with calculated casualness. The dialogues have an improvised goofiness to them when in fact a film as ambitious as this needed to sound far more uniformly restorative. Sadly this overblown franchise film doesn't heal. It only titillates.",entertainment,http://zeenews.india.com/hollywood/avengers-movie-review-the-film-is-a-work-of-overpowering-arrogance-with-raavan-like-super-villain-2103567.html
"Avengers: Infinity War premiered for the general audience on April 27 and the Marvel movie's reviews have been brilliant. The Marvel movie brought together the Avengers, Guardians and the two teams' of allies to fight against Thanos and his Black Order.

While there were a few characters that stood out in the movie, there was one particular Black Order who held the screen whenever she was there, Proxima Midnight. The Marvel villain put up a fantastic fight against Black Widow, Wanda and others in the movie.

But who was the actress behind the brilliant show? It was recently revealed that Carrie Coon has filled the shoes as Proxima Midnight. The casting news was shared by Infinity War directors Joe and Anthony Russo in an interview with British magazine Radio Times.

Coon too confirmed her association on Twitter. She said, ""It's true! My voice and a dazzle of gifted animators have teamed up to play Proxima Midnight. To be fair my face is in there somewhere. #MoCapWhilePregnant.""

The actress is best known for her role in FX's Fargo. She was nominated for an Emmy under the leading actress in a limited series or movie category for her role as Gloria Burgle Fargo's season 3.

She also played a lead character in the critically acclaimed HBO drama The Leftovers. She was seen playing the role of Nora Durst on the show.

She was also seen in movies like Steven Spielberg's The Post and Jody Hill's comedy The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter. Coon worked with Thanos actor Josh Brolin in The Legacy of a Whitetail Deer Hunter, which was premiered at the South by Southwest festival last month. She was seen in Gone Girl.

A post shared by Marvel & DC Fan Page (@mcu.avengers) on Apr 19, 2018 at 12:11pm PDT

While she has a limited role in Infinity War, Coon will be seen in movies like Kin and Widows soon. Proxima is the sole female member of the Black Order.

"Marvel's biggest movie to date, Avengers: Infinity War also turned out to be its most surprising, shocking, and impactful entry in the gargantuan franchise that has produced nineteen films in the last decade. It began on an ominous note, and took some bold swings in its final moments, that could have far-reaching consequences for everyone in its universe. Granted Infinity War does push a tad too much to remain believable, but nonetheless we'll have to wait a little over a year to find out how the Avengers and their allies will come back from a defeat of this magnitude.

With the film now playing in theatres globally, it's time to discuss the big and unexpected events, be it the numerous deaths or the missing characters. We'll also throw out a few theories on Avengers 4 and where it could takes us given what we know from comic books. And lastly, we want to hear what you thought of Infinity War, so please drop your observations and theories in the comments section. Everything from here on is full of Infinity War spoilers, obviously.

Avengers: Infinity War Works on Multiple Levels, and That's a Marvel

SPOILER ALERT: If you haven't seen Infinity War, please stop reading now. Proceed at your own risk.

Deaths

After spending a decade being coy about killing its characters, Marvel's latest made the best of its huge ensemble. Loki was dispatched in the opening sequence, and Gamora fell to her death midway through the film. And the death count racked up massively towards the end, with all of Spider-Man, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Star-Lord, Groot, Bucky Barnes, and Scarlet Witch gone, among others.

That the film actually followed through on Thanos' ludicrous promise to wipe out half of all life in the universe was surprising and shocking, even as the film tipped its hand on how it need not be permanent. Loki and Gamora's deaths likely can't be reversed, but everyone who disintegrated into thin air can be brought back.

There's precedent for this in the source material that partly inspired Infinity War - Jim Starlin's 1991 comic, ""The Infinity Gauntlet"". Though the characters vary, the premise is similar - Thanos has all six Infinity Stones, and he uses it to kill half the universe. Ultimately, Adam Warlock – who was teased in a mid-credits scene for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 – obtains the Infinity Gauntlet, and uses it to undo the deaths caused by Thanos.

It's highly unlikely Warlock will make a surprise appearance in Avengers 4. With Nick Fury sending out a distress signal to Captain Marvel in Infinity War's only post-credits scene, it's a lot likelier that she'll be involved in helping the Avengers retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos. With Strange gone though, who can use the Time Stone remains to be seen.

The Soul Stone

Before Infinity War, the Marvel Cinematic Universe had already given us a glimpse of five of the six Infinity Stones. The only remaining one was the Soul Stone. With Thanos setting out to collect them all, Infinity War had to address it. And in doing so, it included a surprise return of a character.

When Thanos and Gamora arrive on Vormir, they meet the Red Skull, who's credited as Stonekeeper in the film's end credits. Not many would have recognised him, given he hasn't been seen since his first and only appearance seven years ago, in Captain America: The First Avenger.

To refresh your memory, Red Skull aka Johann Schmidt was a Nazi officer and the commander of HYDRA. He became the red monstrosity after injecting himself with the Super Soldier Serum, and in a fight with Cap aboard an aircraft, he grabbed onto the Tesseract, which teleported him across the cosmos. He's been on Vormir ever since, which means he's been the Stonekeeper for over 70 years.

Fun fact: it's not Hugo Weaving playing the character, but rather a different actor: Ross Marquand. Weaving wasn't interested in reprising his role, so they had to replace him. But under such heavy makeup and a hood, it's quite hard to tell who's playing Red Skull to be honest.

Missing characters

Even as Infinity War brought together Marvel's long list of superheroes, there were a few who weren't present onscreen. That includes Ant-Man, Hawkeye, and Valkryie from Thor: Ragnarok. Infinity War explains that both Ant-Man and Hawkeye chose retirement after being freed by Cap at the end of Civil War because they have families, unlike the other vigilantes who didn't sign the Sokovia Accords.

The trailer for Ant-Man and the Wasp, which is set before Infinity War, shows him placed in a house arrest. The Ant-Man sequel will also likely add to Infinity War's explanation. Hawkeye, meanwhile, will be part of Avengers 4, given he was seen on set. His second un-retirement could be down to his own family's disappearance, likely since half the universe vanished thanks to Thanos.

That leaves Valkyrie, who should've been seen in the opening moments of the film, since she was on the ship with Thor and Loki. Her absence suggests she perished in the massacre, though an off-screen death for such an interesting character does seem a bit harsh. Or maybe her death was left on the cutting room floor, which is unfortunate as well.

Some other minor characters went missing from the theatrical cut of Infinity War as well: Happy Hogan, Tony Stark's assistant, and T'Challa's mother Ramonda. The film is already quite long, so a few characters not making the cut is the least you expect.

The future

What will Avengers 4 bring? To answer that, it makes sense to take stock of the current situation. Stark and Nebula are stranded on Titan, Thanos' home planet, with everyone else gone. Back on Earth, the leftovers include Cap, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Rocket among others. Set aside Nebula and Rocket, and there's a common theme here: the contracts for those alive at the end of Infinity War – Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, and Scarlett Johansson – run out with Avengers 4.

On the other hand, many who seemingly died in Infinity War – Tom Holland's Spider-Man, Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, and Chris Pratt's Star-Lord – are already signed on for sequels. Is it possible that the ones who are alive are actually dead, and the ones who disintegrated are still alive? Maybe Thanos ruptured time when he snapped his fingers, and sent our heroes into alternate timelines?

All we can do for now is speculate. But whatever route it takes, Avengers 4 will have to bring back the characters who have to appear in future standalone chapters. The rest will either die for good, like Loki and Gamora, or pass the mantle to the next generation of superheroes.",entertainment,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/features/avengers-infinity-war-spoilers-deaths-soul-stone-avengers-4-1843873

“You are not going to see the latest Avengers’ film? I thought you liked superheroes and were an Avengers’ fan!”

If I had a rupee for every time I have had to hear those sentences in the past few days, I would probably have enough to watch the film being referred to from a cushy seat, and maybe even have change to spare for a bucket of popcorn. However, that is something I am unlikely to spend that money or any money on.

I guess I have finally had my fill of superhero films.

Let me make one thing clear: I love superheroes. I read my first Batman comic when I was all of nine years old, the one in which Leslie Thompkins makes her first appearance (DC #457, as I later found out) and although I loved my Asterix, TinTin, and of course the Three Musketeers, there was a special place for Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, Iron Man and so on. I actually discovered Captain America in a Hostess Twinkies cake advertisement on the back of a Spider-Man comic. I think my parents were a little disappointed that I did not follow Amar Chitra Kathas with the same sort of passion, and mum has still not forgiven me for butchering one of her dupattas while I was pretending to be Batman, only to be chased by a less than impressed dog, but I was known as the person who loved superheroes, be they from the DC or Marvel Universe. I was often advised to “make a library” of my comic book collection and lend them out – advice which I doggedly ignored because I knew that most of them would not return.

The reason is simple: I do not really think I know all those fellas in colourful suits and tights. Not any more. The reason is simple: I do not really think I know all those fellas in colourful suits and tights. Not any more.

And of course, when the eighties and nineties saw superhero films being the rage, with Christopher Reeve as Superman (so overshadowed by Gene Hackmann’s Lex Luthor) and Michael Keaton as Batman (so overshadowed by Jack Nicholson’s Joker), I religiously queued up to see them as well. And when in my third decade of comic book craze, the comic book heroes got rebooted into more “identifiable and vulnerable” cinema characters, well, I watched them too. I loved Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, Christian Bales’ Batman and of course, most of all, Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man.

Which of course, is why so many of my friends are wondering why I am not all a twitter (or a Facebook, sorry, but the pun was there to be made) at the thought of Avengers: Infinity War, which for many people is the biggest superhero film for a while.

I guess I have finally had my fill of superhero films. I guess I have finally had my fill of superhero films.

The reason is simple: I do not really think I know all those fellas in colourful suits and tights. Not anymore. These ladies and gentlemen and their stories have gone off on tangents that have VERY little in common with their comic counterparts. And as if that were not bad enough, suddenly the actors have become more important than the characters they represent. Imagine Bruce Wayne becoming more important than Batman?

For all their goofiness and relative absence of special effects, most of the eighties and nineties stuck to the comic book scripts and stories. That kind of disappeared in the new millennium – Spider-Man was initially a grim student (a far cry from the reckless witty web slinger in the comics), Batman kept having his thunder stolen by villains and his secret identity was known to basically everyone, Iron Man actually sounded more like Spider-Man, Odin seemed to be powerless and forever going into a coma, and hey, Thor had a beard!

What makes things more difficult for a comic book (or graphics novels, as they call them now) follower like me is that the storylines of the films are right off kilter from what we are often reading. And ironically, all this is happening at a time when the graphics novel universe has seen some phenomenal writing. If that sounds hard to believe, just read some of the recent Marvel and DC books. You will be stunned at the nuances of the plots and the exchanges between the characters which sometimes border on pure literature. There is even a Batman series in which Bruce Wayne and not his parents was the person who died that fateful night in an alley in Gotham (no, I am not telling you more – go read the book really). In comparison, the films with their big explosions and special effects, one-liner repartees and wafer-thin plots, just seem shockingly superficial.

Despite being a big fan of comic books, I won’t be seeing Avengers: Infinity War in theatres Despite being a big fan of comic books, I won’t be seeing Avengers: Infinity War in theatres

So what, some will say, films are about entertainment, aren’t they? Perhaps they are. But superheroes are not. For me, at least (so call me naive), superheroes were all about something far more noble – they were about fighting for a cause, standing up for those who could not defended, battling evil and so on. Somewhere down the line, that seems to have been lost in the films, which have become spectacles with larger than life actors (not characters, actors!), massive special effects, and not much in the name of stories. A lot of my friends come back and talk about terrific confrontations and amazing displays of super powers on screens but for some reason, not too many talk about the story. Even in Christopher Nolan’s much-acclaimed Dark Knight series, there were plenty of people mouthing dialogues from the Joker (Heath Ledger), but not too many were able to make sense of why on earth the Batman wanted to become the villain at the end of the film!

These are called story book characters for a reason – they appear in stories. And for me, the story has been the biggest casualty of the current superhero film saga. You may have great actors and terrific drama, but the plot more often than not is pretty much lost in all the noise and special effects. And the Lord alone help you if there is more than one superhero involved for the objective then is more about making sure every superstar gets enough screen time and witty dialogue, rather than getting the story moving. It can be entertaining doubtless, but for me, it is not fair to the characters I grew up with. It is not fair to the fiction that made them so popular that they became silver screen rather than paper page avatars.

It is not fair to the Dark Knight, who so memorably said in “I am Suicide” (narrated by the amazing Tom King):

“I prayed.

And no one

No one answered

No one answered

I was alone

Like everyone else

Like everyone in Gotham

All of us

We are all on our knees

Our hands together

The blood and the blade warm between them

We pray

No one answers

I saw

And I understood…

So that’s what it is

The ears,

the belt,

the gargoyle,

it’s not funny.

It’s the choice of a boy.

The choice to die.

I am Batman.

I am suicide…”

Superheroes? I love them. But I would rather have a book to read about them then a film to watch. For in a book, Iron Man is Tony Stark, and not Robert Downey Jr; Batman is Bruce Wayne, and not Christian Bale; Thor is the son of Odin and the God of Thunder, and not Chris Hemsworth.

A book has heroes. A film has stars.

There is a difference.

"In the lead-up to the trailer launch of Shashanka Ghosh’s Veere Di Wedding, publicity posters were released with the disclaimer #IAmNotAChickFlick. The makers were responding to media reports that had begun referring to the film, starring Kareena Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania, as a “chick flick”.

Both Ghosh and the film’s co-producer Rhea Kapoor did not think their film was a chick flick at all. But they had a discussion about it.

“Rhea wanted to tell the world that this is not a chick flick,” Ghosh told Scroll.in. “I was like, what did you expect, the film is an estrogen tsunami. She asked me if I genuinely thought it was a chick flick. I clarified that I didn’t. The film could have had four boys too as far as I’m concerned. Veere Di Wedding, for me, is a story about friends. It is about how friends know how to be there and help and also know when to pull back.”

The director, whose filmography includes Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part II (2003), Quick Gun Murugan (2009), and Khoobsurat (2014), also read the idea of friendship a little differently. Friends are the new family, he argued.

“The idea of a family, I think, has changed in the last 20-odd years, at least in the urban context,” he said. “For instance, I’ve grown up in a different time when blood was the real family. Some uncle or aunt would be called to get you a job, find you a path or guide you. In the last two decades, I’ve noticed that everyone lives with their friends. Families, in the blood sense of it, are drifting and necessarily so, because job, study and life opportunities have taken people to various places. Over there, it’s just the friends that are there to take care of them.”

When Rhea Kapoor, who also produced Khoobsurat, came to Ghosh with a script about the lives of four female friends, he felt it was the perfect opportunity to delve deeper into his idea of the modern Indian urban family. “Having grown up around really strong women, it was a story I really wanted to tell,” he explained.

Bankrolled by Ekta Kapoor’s Balaji Telefilms in association with Anil Kapoor Films & Communication Network and Saffron Broadcast & Media Ltd, the June 1 release tells the story of Kalindi (Kareena Kapoor), Avni (Sonam Kapoor), Sakshi (Swara Bhaskar) and Meera (Shikha Talsania) as they attempt to figure out the institution of marriage. As the trailer reveals, each of them is at a different juncture in their life: on the verge of being married, on the verge of getting divorced, married without the family’s approval, and looking for a partner.

“The film is very outspoken, urban and as far as tonality is concerned, it is fun,” Ghosh said. “At the same time, it is also about dysfunctionality and dealing with mistakes.”

Play Veere Di Wedding (2018).

Ghosh credits Rhea Kapoor with the basic framework of Veere Di Wedding, including the casting. “She worked hard until she got what she wanted, which was a cast comprising Kareena, Sonam and Swara,” he said. “Shikha’s casting happened fortuitously and I’m very grateful for that.”

Rhea and the writers of the film, Nidhi Mehra and Mehul Suri, took a long time with the script before they came to Ghosh “because they were hell bent on making the story and the expressions as credible as possible”.

This meant that the team decided that they would not censor how their characters speak. The trailer is littered with profanity as a response to trying circumstances. The producers aren’t worried about the censor board awarding cuts since they plan to apply for an A certificate, Ghosh added.

“I have even gone to Ekta [Kapoor] and Rhea with a reworked, fully sanitised version of the script saying that instead of this swear word here, we can say this,” he said. “But they were insistent on keeping it the way it is. They argued that they are not trying to sensationalise the script, but this is just how we speak, even if not all of us say it out loud all the time. I agreed. We are all thinking ‘Bhenchod mangalsutra’ in our heads. One of my favourite lines in the film is when a character says, ‘Fuck this shit man’ and then turns around and says ‘Hello aunty’ when she realises who is around her. We’ve all done this at some point.”

Ghosh didn’t have much to say about directing an ensemble cast. “It’s like me asking you how it is to write an article,” he said. “You just get down to it and write it. Also, the world has changed a lot. I think we have a bunch of really professional actors who do their homework. You only have to tweak their performance rather than actually direct.”

All the actors resonated with their parts well, he added.

Was there ever a fear that one of the actors would overshadow the rest? “Not for me,” he said. “Any good actor will want to give their 200 per cent in order to own the scene they are in. It is actually something to applaud.”

Both Veere Di Wedding and Khoobsurat are markedly different from the films with which Ghosh began his career. His debut, Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part II, was a quirky drama about a man who gets embroiled with the Mumbai underworld. Quick Gun Murugun was a feature-length exploration of the Channel [V] character, a Tamil cowboy who likes his whiskey with masala dosa. Ghosh also directed 10 Minutes, one of the films in the 11-part unreleased anthology Mumbai Cutting (2010).

Play Quick Gun Murugun (2009).

Four years later came Khoobsurat, a Disney film about a prince from Rajasthan (Fawad Khan) who falls in love with a physiotherapist (Sonam Kapoor) who is treating his father. The world of royal, dreamy romance was a distinct shift for Ghosh even though it retained some of his trademark quirkiness and wit.

“After I made the first two films, a famous filmmaker asked me why I was making such films,” Ghosh said. “I replied that as far as I’m concerned, I’m doing good masala entertainment. I’m not making art films. The filmmaker then suggested I do three films with one producer who is as excited about bringing a film out as I am about making it. He said, your craft is good. Just do three films with one producer.”

What did he make of this advice?

“Maybe the filmmaker thought I was too kind of up my own arse, you know,” Ghosh said. “I probably was. I thought I had made good films but I had wanted to do it my way – fully in control. The truth is filmmaking is pure collaboration – between producer and director, actor and director or editors and directors. I think that’s really what that person was saying, that I need to work with a producer that’s as excited as me.”

Ghosh met Rhea Kapoor for the first time to discuss another Disney project that didn’t work out. Then she approached him for Khubsoorat: “I said fuck it, yes. And I had just had this conversation with this filmmaker.”

Play Khoobsurat (2014).

Ghosh has an interesting name for the current turn in his career. “I call this and Khoobsurat a part of my sellout trilogy,” he said. “I often tell Rhea that everyone is offering me these romances now and they’ve all forgotten that I’ve done a gangster film and a film like Quick Gun Murugun. But yes, I had decided I’d make three films the way my producer tells me to make it and I have one more to go. There are ‘want to do’ films and ‘can do’ films. I can do these films and not necessarily lose sleep over wanting to do these films.”

One question lingers: what is the story behind the title of Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part II, especially since there is neither a part one nor three?

“This is about me and that poor boy Samir Gupta, who was a first-time producer, sitting and watching Star Wars three or four, I forget now,” Ghosh said. “I thought if we make a film which claimed to be a part two of something, everyone would come to see it. Of course, during the edit it backfired because suddenly Samir came to me panicking that the audience may not come to see the film thinking they haven’t seen part one. So, we put part one, two, three – all of it in the same film.”",entertainment,https://scroll.in/reel/876949/an-estrogen-tsunami-shashanka-ghosh-on-female-buddy-comedy-veere-di-wedding

"The four accomplished women of Veere Di Wedding – Sonam Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor, Swara Bhaskar and Shikha Talsania — seemed to share a close bond during the trailer launch of the film. And, this was not just a show of camaraderie for the cameras; their off-screen bonding was just as great.

Sonam shuts up anyone casting the slightest doubt on their friendship. “I am telling you, it is the easiest thing to work with other women. Unfortunately, our conditioning is such that people expect women to pull each other down and compete with each other,” she says.

She adds, “But, what’s amazing is to actually work towards the same goal and create the best possible version of something. If all girls come together they can literally move the world.”

Veere Di Wedding is a story about four girlfriends and their journey and is directed by Shashanka Ghosh. Unfortunately, Bollywood has never been keen on making an all-girls film as many feel they would not recover the money.

Sonam says, “It is a story about friendship, about girls. I don’t think such a film has been made before. It is entertaining, it is fun and has got romance, dance and drama. It has got everything. Why can’t women headline a commercial film?”

“Hopefully, with everyone’s support, this will bring about a change in the kind of films that are made and the kind of roles written for us,” she says.",entertainment,https://deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/bollywood/280418/girl-bonding.html

Be it airport casuals or red carpet gowns, Kareena Kapoor Khan has an impeccable fashion sense and she manages to nail most of them with utmost grace and elegance. Recently, we spotted the Ki and Ka actor attending a jewellery event in Delhi looking gorgeous in a Masaba Gupta fusion wear.

Styled by celebrity stylist Tanya Ghavri, she picked a printed cobalt blue skirt, which was teamed with an asymmetric tunic, both from Masaba Gupta’s latest collection. The ‘blue desert sage fusion set’ is a great take on Indo-western trend and we like the fact that she chose not to carry a dupatta and gave it an interesting look. Her outfit was further combined with a statement gold necklace and matching danglers from Malabar Gold and Diamonds.

Make-up artist Subbu rounded off Khan’s look with glossy lips, well-defined eyes and a nude make-up palette. Meanwhile, hairstylist Gabriel Georgiou styled her hair in a sleek manner.

Prior to this, we had Khan attending Veere Di Wedding promotions in a power suit, which was also in a deep blue shade. Styled by Rhea Kapoor, Khan was seen in a navy blue bandeau top teamed with a pair of matching pants and a jacket. The deep hues of the pantsuit accented the creamy complexion of her dewy make-up. Neutral lips and smokey eyes added a dramatic touch to the actor’s look and she rounded it off with her hair coiffed into soft curls and a gold watch.

"World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) put on the Greatest Royal Rumble on Sunday. The big event, the event as part of a 10-year deal with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, came just three weeks after WrestleMania 34.

The Greatest Royal Rumble (WWE GRR) featured an absolutely stacked card featuring Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, John Cena, Triple H, The Undertaker, Ruserv and a 50-man royal rumble.

Here's what happened at the Greatest Royal Rumble:

John Cena defeats Triple H

The Jedahh crowd got to see two of the biggest names square off as the opening act. It was a routine match but John Cena and Triple H got great reactions from the crowd. Triple H mocked Cena's five-knuckle shuffle and hit him with a DeGeneration X crotch chop. Both kicked out of each other's finishing move. In the end, Cena reversed a crossface submission into an Attitude Adjustment before hitting a second one for the clean pin.

It was a great match but it failed to get the crowd excited. Both, Alexander and Kalisto performed their best moves and finishes. In the end, Alexander countered a Salida del Sol attempt to hit his Lumbar Check for the 1-2-3.

""Woken"" Matt Hardy & Bray Wyatt defeat The Bar to win the vacant RAW Tag Team Championships

It was a short match and the result was expected. Sheamus was about to hit his Brogue kick but was interrupted by Wyatt's spider walk. Sheamus missed the kick, allowing Wyatt to his Sister Abigail. Wyatt and Hardy hit their elevated Twist of Fate to put Sheamus away.

Jeff Hardy defeats Jinder Mahal to retain the United States Championship

The saw a comical botch in which Hardy badly missed a Whisper in the Wind from the top rope and Mahal still bumped for it seconds later. The finish came when Hardy packaged a Twist of Fate with a Swanton Bomb off the top rope for the 1-2-3.

Bludgeon Brothers' demolition of the SmackDown tag team division continued.

Seth Rollins defeats The Miz, Finn Balor & Samoa Joe to retain the Intercontinental Championship in a Ladder match

The four men provided some spots in a match that was under-appreciated by the crowd. Miz and Balor used ladders as a foundation to hit their finishing moves on. Joe snuck underneath a superplex attempt from Rollins on Balor to hit a powerbomb. However, the it was the that stole the show. Balor appeared to have a clear path up a ladder in the center of the ring. Suddenly, Rollins jumped off the top rope onto the other side of the ladder, ran up it and stole the title.

AJ Styles vs Shinsuke Nakamura ends in a double count-out

It was great match and looked set to be another classic in the making. However, the finish let the match down. It saw multiple exchanges of physical strikes in the center of the ring and Nakamura landing yet another low blow after Styles missed his forearm finisher and was distracted by nearly landing on the referee.

Both countered out of each other's finishing move until the action spilled to the floor. But that's where the action stayed as the match ended in a disappointing double countout.

The Undertaker defeats Rusev in a Casket Match

It was good match given The Undertaker's age and the fear that Rusev would receive a John-Cena-at-Wrestlemani-esque loss. Aiden English played a big role by constantly interfering in this no-disqualification match. In the end, Undertaker went on to hit a chokeslam before throwing Rusev into the casket. English then ate both a chokeslam and a tombstone piledriver. Undertaker closed the casket with bot Rusev and English inside.

Brock Lesnar defeats Roman Reigns to retain the Universal Championship

WWE again shocked everyone who expected Brock to lose the title here. The steel cage match was physical and neither superstar could get a three count and both failed during attempts to climb over the cage.

Reigns appeared close to leaving through the side door only to have Paul Heyman slam it in his face. Reigns speared Lesnar through the cage wall and onto the floor in a stunning climax. Lesnar's back hit the floor resulting in a controversial victory as two feet are what should've given someone a legal victory.

"World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) put on the Greatest Royal Rumble on Sunday. The big event, the event as part of a 10-year deal with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, came just three weeks after WrestleMania 34.

Here's what happened at the Greatest Royal Rumble:

John Cena defeats Triple H

The Jedahh crowd got to see two of the biggest names square off as the opening act. It was a routine match but John Cena and Triple H got great reactions from the crowd. Triple H mocked Cena's five-knuckle shuffle and hit him with a DeGeneration X crotch chop. Both kicked out of each other's finishing move. In the end, Cena reversed a crossface submission into an Attitude Adjustment before hitting a second one for the clean pin.

WWE’s Greatest Royal Rumble proved to be a historic event as the monster among men, Braun Strowman went on to triumph in the first ever-50 man rumble match held in the picturesque city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

AJ Styles also retained his WWE Championship. Universal Champion Brock Lesnar also continued his championship reign after a controversial end to the match.

Several big names participated in the Rumble including the likes of Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle, 2016 Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal winner Baron Corbin, four-time Tag Team Champions The New Day, and three-time World Heavyweight Champion and nine-time Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho.

Holy shit, first time I've ever heard like 95% of a crowd cheer for Cena since 03! #WWEGRR — Jason V. 🌐 (@Jas0nVelez) April 27, 2018

Watching @JohnCena's entrance at the Greatest Royal Rumble event was awesome. Took me back to his entrance at WrestleMania 25 with all of the John Cena's lined up all the way down the ramp. It was fantastic to see that with kids 🔥🔥🔥#WWEGRR #NeverForget pic.twitter.com/DOf8xwYpaB — JohnCenaCrews™ (@JohnCenaCrews) April 27, 2018

Oh baby, #WWEChampionship time! I dig the new theme music for Shinsuke Nakamura. Slick stuff. #WWEGRR — Justin Watry (@JustinWatry) April 27, 2018

Shinsuke so much better as a heel. AJ is off the charts good. #WGRR — Steve Austin (@steveaustinBSR) April 27, 2018

While he’s bound to lose against The Undertaker. Being in a match against him in Saudi Arabia is big for Rusev, and the #WWE acknowledging he’s a big name. #WWEGRR — Charles (@Chucks93) April 27, 2018

Man, they gave Rusev and actual match against Undertaker. Made him look better than Cena. I’m happy with that! 👍 #WWEGRR — Ben Leonard (@BenALeonard) April 27, 2018

Braun might have won the #WWEGRR but @TitusONeilWWE stole the damn show!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 bravo! I’ll finally say it! TITUS....WORLDWIDE!!!! — Lina Fanene (@NiaJaxWWE) April 27, 2018

The ending of the cage match was so poorly botched that the commentators were struggling to defend it. “Well to win you have to be the first person to land... well both feet errr... you can see from this slow motion replay that umm... shit.” #WWEGRR — Tim Rose Tweeting (@TimRoseTweeting) April 27, 2018

@shanemcmahon was in the ring.

He then went under the bottom rope.

He climbed from the outside to the top rope.

He then was thrown out of the ring. But not from inside the ring.

He was never eliminated.

Finished watching #WWEGRR and I have a few thoughts:



1. The IC title match ending was pretty anticlimactic.

2. The end of the Universal title match was cool.

3. The GRR had a lot of filler.

4. Braun winning was a great choice.

5. The event as a whole was underwhelming. — Preston Byers (@PresByers) April 27, 2018

All those huge names, all those giant matches, all those gimmicks, all the expenses spent on production... And what's everyone talking about?



Titus O’Neal tripping over.



I LOVED IT.#WWEGRR — Adam Hughes🇮🇪🖕 🇮🇪 (@TheHughezy) April 27, 2018

Is this Brock/Roman nightmare ever going to end? #WWEGRR — J.M. Carpenter (@Duke_Libertas) April 27, 2018

Roman should've won as his feet hit the ground first and also, Hornswoggle never got thrown over the top rope. He, himself, got under the ropes and then on top of the turnbuckle but never thrown over the top rope. 🙄#WWEGRR — Wrestling (@WrestlinggNewss) April 27, 2018

People complaining about the Brock/Reigns result.... @wwe are just planting the seeds and making you actually like and back Roman without you knowing it #played #WWEGRR — shaun williamson (@shaunw87) April 27, 2018

Think about this. Braun strowman won the main event of a show in Saudi Arabia that they paid $200 million to have instead of Roman or Cena. Let that sink in. Braun is the biggest star in WWE #WWEGRR — chase4axw (@chase4axw) April 27, 2018

And being a WWE fan of Iranian Descent and a fan of both of them it was nice to see Ariya and Shawn The Daivari Brothers together in a WWE ring. Happy with The Undertaker getting another win too. #WWEGRR was pretty good overall imo. — Captain Simon Pirooz (@SimonTheCaptain) April 27, 2018

Really great and entertaining show.



Braun Strowman the deserving winner and am so happy for him.



Never more happy that seeing RUSEV in the ring with my all-time favourite Undertaker #RUSEVDAY



Match of the night has to be either the IC or WWE Title!



MVP: Titus#WWEGRR — 'El Idolo' Ethan Evans (@FightEvansFight) April 27, 2018

It's Brock Lesnar who put over Roman Reigns to legit everyone at the end of the day. He did something John Cena, Undertaker, Triple H, Randy Orton and many others couldn't do. #WWEGRR — Pulkit. (@FerventMaharaja) April 27, 2018

1.@WWERomanReigns gets robbed of victory

2. The 50 man rumble received these hands from @BraunStrowman

3. Cena vs HHH, BEST WAY TO KICK OFF A SHOW.

4. @AJStylesPh still is Phenomenal.#WWEGRR pic.twitter.com/g4kJ7FkHH8 — CJ Orndorff (@FalconsCJ) April 27, 2018

I'll give the GOAT Rumble 6/10 because welp, outcomes could've been better. But 10/10 for Jinder and Titus' performance #WWEGRR — Pulkit. (@FerventMaharaja) April 27, 2018

If somebody could make a gif where Titus tripping causes Jinder's botch I would publicly declare my love for you. #wwegrr — everythinglovebrings (@everythinglov18) April 27, 2018

Disappointing winner of the #WWEGRR 😪. Nevertheless, it was aired at a sensible time for once and it was actually a decent show. Obviously the women situation didn't help it. Jinder's botch and Titus' trip were hilarious. Worth watching for that alone 😂 — Alex Reed (@TheRealAlderado) April 27, 2018",entertainment,https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/twitter-reacts-to-the-wwe-greatest-royal-rumble-event
"The Greatest Royal Rumble show was much like the match itself — it started slow and, though predictable, ended strong.

The WWE Network special Friday in in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, felt part house show, part WrestleMania. There was plenty of pageantry — even lots of pyro — but a lack of substance outside of a few matches.

The jumbo-sized card did not include the WWE’s women, even on the kickoff panel, because of the country’s laws. The company reportedly made more than $100 million for the event and is said to be paying its women performers in a big way even though they did not appear on the show, which featured the first 50-man Royal Rumble match.

While none of the seven titles defended changed hands, the WWE didn’t leave Saudi Arabia without controversy.

Roman Reigns should be the Universal champion whether you like it or not and no matter what the referee’s decision was in his steel cage match against Brock Lesnar.

Reigns, in a physical bout that was better than their subpar clash at WrestleMania, speared Lesnar through the cage onto the floor near the ramp for the finish. By rule, you can win the match by being the first person to leave the cage and have both feet hit the floor.

Though Lesnar’s back was first to hit, his feet didn’t hit before Reigns’. Lesnar’s legs were elevated on the destroyed portion of the cage as Reigns rolled off and touched the floor.

The commentary team tried to explain during the replays why the referee ruled Lesnar would retain his title, until they realized they couldn’t. At that point, whether you believe it was planned or not, they relented that Reigns could have some controversy on his hands.

WWE needs to eventually build off this. It might be the best route to finally putting the strap on Reigns.

The moment — along with Titus O’Neil purposely tripping his way under the ring while entering the rumble match — was one of the highlights of a strong latter portion of the show.

The rumble itself moved quickly even with 50 guys. Daniel Bryan – eliminated second to last by new rival Big Cass — entered first and lasted a record one hour, 16 minutes and five seconds. Cass was eliminated by the victorious Braun Strowman, one of the clear favorites coming in. He was awarded a large trophy and a green belt after a record 13 eliminations.

The match was a mid-card paradise for the most part with enough legends and top guys to make it work. Returning Rey Mysterio and Chris Jericho both were given their moment. Even Hornswoggle made an appearance.

Shane McMahon pulled off his coast-to-coast and was eliminated when Strowman threw him from the top rope on the announcer’s table. Kofi surviving elimination while on Xavier Woods’ back was among the usual Rumble spots that made the match enjoyable, despite plenty of unknown NXT call-ups.

While there was a clear winner to the Rumble match, the feud between WWE champion AJ Styles and Shinsuke Nakamura is still searching for one after a double count out.

This match was on a similar level to their WrestleMania one and further raised the heat around their feud by showing us a side of Styles we hadn’t seen before.

After taking another low blow and breaking the pin by grabbing the ropes, something snapped inside Styles. He unleashed a physical fury on Nakamura. Styles dove into him and went crashing into the announcer table, pounded him in the barricade, used a chair and hit one last Phenomenal Forearm. This feud should have your attention in a big way now.

The Intercontinental title ladder match between champion Seth Rollins, Samoa Joe, Finn Balor and The Miz was arguably the best match on the card, with as good a finish as WWE has scripted in a while. It jump-started the event’s strong second half. The match was physical, made good use of the ladder and created some suspense for who would win. However, it will be remembered for its ending.

Balor cleared out Miz and Joe and the title appeared within reach. Rollins climbed to the top turnbuckle on the opposite side and leaped onto the ladder. He jetted to the top and raced to rip the championship off the hook before a shocked Balor could even react to Rollins retaining.

It was some brilliant storytelling because it added a new chapter to the feud between Rollins and Balor. It also reestablishes Rollins as the opportunistic champion he thrived as during his WWE title run.

Undertaker’s casket match — while still a compilation of greatest-hits moves — was better than his clash at WrestleMania with John Cena and a lot of that is because of Rusev.

Rusev (who got in more offense than Cena and didn’t have to take a Tombstone) sold extremely well and proved a superb foil to The Deadman. Rusev freaking out when being put on top of the closed casket was brilliant. Having the match end with Taker putting Rusev and Aiden English in the casket was also a nice touch.

Thankfully, matches like this one kept the Greatest Royal Rumble show from being a great big flop because of what preceded them. Like WrestleMania, a stacked event limited the undercard’s potential.

Other matches

Matt Hardy and Bray Wyatt over The Bar to win the Raw Tag Team titles

The team from “Raw” beat the team now on “SmackDown Live” for the Raw tag titles. No surprises here in a generic match made more for Raw than a special event. Hardy and Wyatt’s push continues and could be creative gold.

The Bludgeon Brothers over The Usos to retain the SmackDown tag titles

The match — like many early in the card — was short, but this one was effective enough. There a good balance of the Usos’ speed and Harper and Rowan’s power. The Bludgeon Brothers looked dominant while winning.

Jeff Hardy over Jinder Mahal to retain the United States title

There was plenty of silence from the crowd during this match, which was short, very uninspired and sloppy at times — including an awful botch by Mahal on Hardy’s Whisper in the Wind move from the top rope. He fell without being hit. Hardy, even at this age, is better than this match and Mahal continues to mostly underdeliver in big spots.

John Cena over Triple H

It was a smart match to open the show because the sight of these legends got the crowd into it. The match was slow and dated with all the cliché bells and whistles you’d expect. There was a test of strength, a sleeper hold, a DX chop and a few mocking “You can’t see me” hand gestures before Cena pinned Triple H after a third Attitude Adjustment.

Cedric Alexander over Kalisto to retain the Cruiserweight title

The faster pace and acrobatics juxtaposed well with the methodical Triple H-Cena clash. Alexander going with power moves to counteract Kalisto’s creativity was good in theory, but only a few high spots resonated with the crowd. Alexander won with a slick counter of the Salida Del Sol with a Lumbar Check for the win, but got little crowd reaction.

Biggest winner: AJ Styles

Biggest loser: Jinder Mahal

Best Match: Intercontinental title ladder match

"Tripura CM Biplab Deb (Express photo by Abhisek Saha/File) Tripura CM Biplab Deb (Express photo by Abhisek Saha/File)

Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb today regretted his remarks questioning the crowning of Diana Hayden as “Miss World” in 1997 and alleging that international beauty contests were a farce. “I was talking about how the handlooms of the state could be marketed well. If anybody is hurt or feeling defamed, I regret this… I respect all women as my mother,” he told reporters.

Deb, who had kicked up a storm by his “Internet in the Mahabharata era” remark, landed himself in a fresh controversy when he questioned the rationale behind Hayden’s win 21 years ago. He had said he failed to understand the “process of judgement” of the crowning of the Miss World contest in 1997, in which Hayden won the award.

Deb, however, was all praise for Aishwarya Rai, who won the Miss World crown in 1994, saying she “represents the Indian women in the true sense”. His remarks drew criticism from various quarters, including beauty pageant contestants, social workers and his political opponents.

Panchali Bhattacharjee, social worker and wife of former Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar, said Deb’s comments were “unexpected”. “Beauty pageant winners work very hard. It is not right to demean them in any way. Besides, we do not see women in any stereotypical manner. They should have the freedom to express themselves as Laxmi, Saraswati or otherwise,” she added.

Femina Miss India contestant from Tripura Mamita Debbarma said, “It is a shame that our chief minister is making such comments.” Asserting that beauty pageant contestants had to work very hard to win a crown, she said, “The governments of other states felicitate and promote those who win these accolades. This comment is very unfortunate.”

State Congress vice president and social worker Basana Debnath said, “Diana Hayden is an Indian woman and I think our chief minister’s comment has no value. It is uncalled for and does not suit a politician. “In our country, a three-year girl is raped, but there is hardly any voice against it. I ask, why would people like Asaram and Ram Rahim not be hanged? Nobody is vocal about this. I want a comment from our chief minister.”

Fulan Bhattacharya, social worker and Mayor in Council of the Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC), run by the CPI(M), was also critical of Deb’s comments. “This is none of his business. I am completely against stereotyping Indian beauty as goddess Laxmi and Saraswati. This is an old and retrogressive thought process, like that of a fundamentalist. The rest of the country is laughing at our chief minister’s comment and we are also ashamed,” she said.

State Congress vice-president Tapas Dey said, “His (Deb’s) comments are divisive. He tried to differentiate between Aishwarya Rai and Diana Hayden with a clear motive, but both of them were judged by those who, according to Deb, are international mafia.”

Speaking at a design workshop yesterday, Deb had further alleged that beauty pageant organisers were the international marketing mafia, who spotted a huge market in India. His comments came days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned the BJP leaders to steer clear of controversies and not offer “masala” to the media by making irresponsible statements.

Earlier this month, Deb, an arts graduate, had claimed that Internet and satellite communication existed in the days of Mahabharata, which had drawn criticism from Twitterati, intellectuals and his political adversaries.

"Internet and satellite existed since Mahabharata era, claims Tripura CM Biplab Deb

AGARTALA: Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb claimed that internet and satellite are not something new but existed since the Mahabharata era. Speaking at a Regional Workshop on Computerisation and Reforms at Pragna Bhawan in Agartala, Deb said that the internet was invented by India lakhs of years ago. ""Internet and satellite communication had existed in the days of Mahabharata. How could Sanjaya (the charioteer of King Dhritarashtra) give a detailed account and description to the blind king about the battle of Kurukshetra? It means internet was there, the satellites and that technology was there in this country at that time,"" he said. The BJP leader said that the European nations and the United States may claim that it is their invention, but it is actually India's technology. ""Internet and satellite system had existed in India during lakhs of years ago. The richest culture belongs to our nation and I feel proud of it. Even today in internet and software technology, we are ahead. See Microsoft, it may be a U.S. company but most of its engineers are all from our country,"" he added. The Tripura Chief Minister viewed that since the era of the Mahabharata, India was top in technology but somehow in the middle, it got lost. ""But, again today India has regained its position in technology in the world and it can be proved from the fact that a large number of software engineers play a vital role in the US companies,"" the Chief Minister said. Deb further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given a big push to digitisation by making it accessible to citizens across the country. ""Our Prime Minister himself is active on social networking sites and he asks the MPs and even the Chief Ministers about their presence on social media. We are lucky enough to have a guardian-like Prime Minister,"" he added. Read this story in Marathi Read this story in Malayalam",entertainment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Biplab-Deb

"Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb said Diana Hayden won the Miss World title because of fashion mafia

He called Aishwarya Rai Bachchan the Indian beauty and said she deserved to win the crown

Deb earlier said internet and satellite communication existed in Mahabharata days

In 1997, Diana Hayden made India proud when she was crowned Miss World, but Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb now believes that Hayden was not good enough to win the title. He, in fact, praised Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who became Miss World in 1994, and said she has the essence of the beauty of Indian women.

Deb was in Agartala, capital of India's northeast state Tripura, to attend a workshop on handlooms when he made the remark and launched an attack on the fashion industry. He also took a jibe at women who are ""foxed by marketing and advertisements"".

He said that Hayden was crowned the winner in 1997 by ""international fashion mafias"" because of business reasons.

""Even Dayna Hayden got it (the world title). See, everyone is laughing. Tell me, was Diana Hayden supposed to get it? Aishwarya Rai got it. That's justified, because she carries the essence of the beauty of Indian women. Indian beauty is all about Goddess Laxmi, Goddess Saraswati... Diana Hayden does not fit to that class of beauty,"" Deb said, according to NDTV.

He then added that: ""I am not opposing her though.""

Reuters

Deb said that there are no more Miss World winners from India because the jury of the beauty pageant has gone somewhere else. But he completely missed out the point that Miss World 2017 was Manushi Chillar from India's north Indian state of Haryana.

""International companies made prior plans to take over our Indian traditional products and consequently, we got Miss World from India five times. Any Indian contestant seemed to be able to take part in the Miss World contest and win the crown, even Diana Hayden got it. I am not criticising her but didn't find traits of Indian beauty in her,"" he said.

This is Deb's second such remark in a week. Earlier, he became a butt of jokes on Twitter when he said that internet and satellite communication had existed in the days of Mahabharata.

""Internet and satellite communication had existed in the days of Mahabharata. How could Sanjaya (the charioteer of King Dhritarashtra) give a detailed account and description to the blind king about the battle of Kurukshetra?

"Priyanka Chopra reprises her role as Alex Parrish in Quantico Season 3. Priyanka Chopra reprises her role as Alex Parrish in Quantico Season 3.

American TV show Quantico that made Priyanka Chopra a household name is coming back to our television screens with a brand new season on April 28. This third season will take a leap of three years from where the last season left and new showrunner Michael Seitzman who takes over the reigns from Joshua Safran, plans to completely revamp the show for the audiences now. As for what has happened in those three years, while some major players have departed, Alex Parrish has some new allies and new enemies to fight against. Before you sit down to watch Quantico Season 3, here’s everything you need to know about the show.

It is not just director Michael Seitzman who joins Quantico’s sets with this new season. Chopra will have a strong ally in the form of Oscar winner Marlee Matlin’s Jocelyn, a deaf ex-FBI agent who is especially good with her observational skills. While Matlin will make an appearance in the premiere itself, as Parrish’s journey progresses, more new people are set to join course including musician Alan Powell as undercover agent Mike McQuigg. Along with Chopra, series regulars Ryan (Jake McLaughlin), Owen (Blair Underwood), Shelby (Johanna Braddy) and Harry (Russell Tovey) reprise their roles. Also, Aunjanue Ellis, Yasmine Al Massri and Pearl Thusi are out.

Plot takes a leap

As I mentioned earlier, the new season will pick up things three years after the Season 2 finale. The last time we saw Alex, she and Ryan ran off together and Owen became the Deputy Director of the CIA. But as the teasers have suggested, now, Alex has been living a peaceful, anonymous life somewhere in Italy. The previous flashbacks timeline has also been ditched this time.

The official plot synopsis reads, “Alex is forced to abandon her idyllic existence when Ryan persuades her to help him rescue Shelby from a notorious international arms dealer known only as The Widow, who is holding her hostage – and in exchange for her release she demands something that only Alex can provide. Ryan and Alex recruit Owen and Harry to help rescue their friend and defeat the villain. To help the cause, Owen brings in former agent Jocelyn Turner, who has her own dark past with The Widow.”

Can’t wait to see Harry return when #Quantico premieres tomorrow 10|9c! pic.twitter.com/jiSslaGtb8 — Quantico ABC (@QuanticoTV) April 25, 2018

Showrunner Seitzman reveals the ideology behind the plot leap as to how he wanted the show to have an appeal to both new viewers and the viewers who have been around from the first season. He wanted to execute some major changes and bring in some new character backstories, so that people who haven’t seen the show previously can also make out what’s happening. “I wanted to reset the relationships. So for starters, I thought, ‘Well, maybe you start three years later.’ That buys you a lot. A lot happens in three years, right?” he told Entertainment Weekly.

Tonal Shift

Seitzman has also revealed in several of his interviews how there will be a huge tonal shift in the show’s narrative this time along. Apart from hitting reset on the core characters, the show will have a more classy spy-genre feel this time. While there is a warmer tone and new look and score to look forward to, this season Alex’s journey will see her grappling with the choice of the kind of life she wants to live: of constant action in the face of threats, or of peace. There is also a certain global appeal to the show now, as much of the scene takes place out of New York City, in places like Ireland, Italy included.

You can watch Quantico’s third season from April 28 and the show will air every Saturday at 9 PM on Star World in India.

David Blaine Sews His Mouth Shut in Insane Trick (w/Jimmy, Priyanka Chopra & The Roots)

http://www.youtube.com/fallontonight",entertainment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82QbMrg2HoI
"Priyanka Chopra has been busy promoting the latest season of Quantico over the last few days. This will be Priyanka Chopra's third season starring as Alex Parrish in the hit American TV series. As is the case with most things related to Priyanka Chopra, her outfits for the promotions of Quantico have been more than just stylish. Priyanka Chopra knows how to nail every trend, and even with the most mundane of outfits, she manages to somehow make them look new and innovative. Her outfit choices over the last few days have been perfectly representative of spring (yes, it's just about spring in New York, which is where Priyanka has been). Safe to say Priyanka's sartorial choices have not disappointed, yet again. Each outfit seems carefully and diligently picked out by Priyanka's stylist, Mimi Cutrell (who also happens to be Gigi and Bella Hadid's stylist). We also absolutely love how each outfit has been paired with a miniature handbag. Spring trend alert?



Priyanka started her promotional tour in a powder blue floral print outfit by fashion label, Brock Collection. She matched a pair of rectangular shaded sunglasses from Le Specs and a miniature white bag with her outfit. She also wore a pair of strappy white sandals from Simon Porte Jacquemus' collection. Priyanka went ahead an joked a little by adding the caption ""Florals for spring...so original."" to her picture. Sartorial elegance and sarcasm? We think we just fell in love with her all over again.



A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Apr 24, 2018 at 3:44pm PDT

Her second outfit of choice was a red leather suit from Alejandra Alonso Rojas with a bright red trench coat from Vivienne Westwood on top. She paired the ensemble with equally bright red Louboutin shoes and a miniature black leather handbag. Red lips and a pair of black oval sleek shades, and we were sold to Priyanka's charm.

A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Apr 25, 2018 at 1:23pm PDT

Her third outfit, and possibly our favourite was the lemon floral turtleneck bodysuit paired with the lemon floral silk chiffon hand draped skirt by Prabal Gurung. With this outfit Priyanka carried a hot pink mini top handle bag from Jason Stalvey. Don't miss her Illesteva cat eye sunglasses and her Gianvito Rossi peep toe shoes with a transparent front strap and green side bows.

A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Apr 26, 2018 at 11:44am PDT

Priyanka chose a less colourful outfit for her next appearance, but very spring appropriate and chic nonetheless. She picked a pistachio green ankle length skirt from Christopher Bu, a black bodysuit from commando by Kerry O'Brien and a pair of chunky-heeled mules from Ritch Erani.

A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on Apr 26, 2018 at 11:56am PDT

Priyanka Chopra switched back to being colourful in a Vivienne Westwood dress for her fifth look. She kept it simple and classic by carrying a white Versace bag and wearing a pair of grey Louboutin pointed toe heels.

After those hectic couple of days on her press tour, Priyanka Chopra is now heading back to India for just two days. More power to her - and good luck for Quantico season 3.",entertainment,https://swirlster.ndtv.com/style/in-5-looks-priyanka-chopra-has-won-spring-fashion-1843830
"Priyanka Chopra will be soon back on the home turf and will unite with Salman Khan for Bharat after a long hiatus of 10 years. The film, produced by Atul Agnihotri, will be helmed by Tiger Zinda Hai director Ali Abbas Zafar.

Now in what can be called the biggest casting coup in years, Priyanka termed Salman's film as the quintessential Bollywood movie. Speaking to an international magazine, PeeCee said, ""I’ve finished up two films: A Kid Like Jake, which comes out in June. And Isn’t it Romantic?, which comes out Valentine’s Day 2019. I play a spoiled rich woman who is a yoga guru, which is not a thing. [Bharat] is the Indian movie I signed this year. It’s the quintessential Bollywood movie, which I haven’t done in many years. A lot of them were dramatic and thematic. This one’s going to be out and out entertainment. I’m excited! I haven’t been back to do a movie in two or three years now.""

Well, we certainly expect a lot from Bharat as the film marks Priyanka's comeback, whose last release was Jai Gangaajal in 2016.

Meanwhile, on joining the Bharat family, Priyanka shared her excitement and said, ""Bharat it is! I’m looking forward to begin shooting this film and working with Salman and Ali again after a considerable time. I’ve learnt a lot from them in our previous collaborations and am excited to see what this one has to offer. I’m also looking forward to working with Alvira and Atul and the entire team of Bharat.To all my well-wishers who’ve been so patient and supportive… thank you for your constant support and I’ll see you all at the movies.""

Bharat is slated for an Eid 2019 release.",entertainment,http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-here-s-what-priyanka-chopra-has-to-say-about-salman-khan-s-bharat-2609235

Priyanka Chopra and Jimmy Fallon Compete in a Skittles Challenge

http://www.youtube.com/fallontonight",entertainment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQpilk--knM
"Warning: The following contains spoilers from the season 3 premiere of Quantico. Read at your own risk!

A lot can change in three years. Quantico returned with a three-year time jump after the events of the season 2 finale, and in that time, Alex (Priyanka Chopra) left Ryan (Jake McLaughlin) and moved to Italy, where she built a new family. When the two reunited, she discovered that Ryan had married Shelby (Johanna Braddy) — yes, Shelby, her best friend from their days as FBI trainees. By the end of the premiere, she teams up with some former allies, Owen (Blair Underwood) and Harry (Russell Tovey), along with a new addition in ex-FBI agent Jocelyn (Marlee Matlin), to form a black-ops group working against threats to the U.S.

But is that truly what Alex wants when she has the perfect life waiting for her across the Atlantic? And is this really the end of Ryan and Alex? Below, Chopra chats about Alex’s future, her romantic travails, and how she feels about the series’ new look (including that cinematic opening sequence).

ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Let’s start with Alex and Ryan, who are no longer together. Ryan’s now married to Shelby. How did you react when you read that in the script?

PRIYANKA CHOPRA: Well, it was horrible, you know? When I read it, I was mind-blown. She’s super-chill about it and she’s like, “It doesn’t matter,” because somewhere, she understands that she wronged him. They ran away together, and he was willing to give up everything for her, but Alex leaves. She disappears. She knows that it wasn’t right for her to do it, and now that he’s found her happiness with her best friend, it’s on her to accept that, so she can’t in any world hold it against Shelby or Ryan. They found each other in their grief, which she created. So it’s such a complicated, mature way of dealing with it, that I really loved it. And you’ll see through the season, their dynamics always pop up in a weird way.

So where do you think Alex’s headspace is at right now? Is she comfortable with being back in the game, with this team?

The one thing Alex knows, the only thing Alex knows, is she’s a patriot. She wants to serve her country, and her country and her duty comes first for her, before her personal life, before herself, before the people she loves. So that’s something that you see Alex coming to terms with, but at the same time throughout this whole season, you see her struggling with who she is. Like, as a person, who is she? What does she want? She’s always been so conflicted with the men in her life, so what does that eventually mean? You’ll see her really growing this season and exposing a very vulnerable part of herself.

RELATED: Get the lowdown on the Emmys with EW’s new CHASING EMMY podcast

She did find a family and almost settle down in Italy. How does that affect her going forward?

I think Alex sees [Isabella] as her daughter, almost. She spends this time with Andrea and Isabella for two or three years, where she built a little family with them and they built a family with her, so eventually when she gives them up, she gives them up to keep them safe. She wouldn’t give them up for anything in the world, but she knows that she spells trouble, so she gives up her heart. But you will see both of these characters pop up again in the season, for sure. They’re very close to Alex’s heart.

Now, another addition in Alex’s life is Marlee Matlin’s Jocelyn. Did you learn ASL this season?

Marlee teaches me ASL all the time. Alex can speak it, but I can’t. My brain for some reason can’t coordinate with my hands. [Laughs] Marlee tries so hard to teach me, and then I just mess it up, so I basically just learn the bad words. [Laughs] As with every new language, you know? The first things you learn are the bad words.

What can you tell me about her character going forward this season?

Jocelyn’s a huge asset. She can read lips, she has incredible Spidey senses, and she comes in as a major asset to the team. And we love Marlee on the show — she’s like a big mama on the set, she’s always taking us all out. She’s really brought us together.

Showrunner Michael Seitzman said that each of the episodes this season is self-contained enough to allow anyone to jump in anytime. Can you tease some more of the adventures to come?

I agree with Michael. You can watch every episode and you would still be able to keep up with the storyline because that’s the format we’ve taken this year. With Alex, you see a lot of new things in her life. You’ll see a potential new love interest, you’ll see personal relationships — with her mom, with her family. And because Alex has always been a lone fighter, she has a hard time working with a team. That’s really interesting to see.

Now, I have to ask: Did you see the new opening title sequence? What did you think?

I love it! It’s like an homage to the old-world spy thrillers, you know? Old Hollywood spy thrillers. I love that about it, because that’s the vein of the show this year. It’s very cinematic. The point was to do a full revamp. I really liked it when Michael sent it to me. Before I even saw the show, he sent me that, because he was so excited about it.

"While mom Kareena Kapoor Khan had a busy work day in New Delhi, her son Taimur was at the pool with his cousin, Inaaya in Mumbai. The toddler was spotted by the paparazzi with his aunt Soha Ali Khan, uncle Kunal Kemmu and their daughter, enjoying a chill Friday together in Bandra.

The new pictures show Inaaya taking a dip in the pool with some help from her doting mother and father. Soha then picks up her adorable baby and wraps her in a towel. Taimur, however, did not step into the pool. He enjoyed spotting birds in the trees instead.

Soha recently said that it doesn’t bother her when Inaaya is compared to Taimur. “You know, I am someone who has lived in the public eye. Comparison is something that people love to do. I was compared to my mother, my brother to our father and me to my brother. Now, Taimur to Inaaya. People enjoy it. I come across Instagram posts of Inaaya and Taimur picture together and they ask ‘which baby is cuter?’ It is ridiculous but people comment too. This is human nature. You just have to laugh at it as much as you can,” she told The Indian Express.

She also wants Inaaya to grow up with her cousin Taimur just the way she grew up with her brother. She said, “Bhai and I have an 8-year age difference. But Taimur and Inaaya will only have a year’s. I hope they grow fond of each other as they grow up, become best friends. Of course, Taimur is a little older so he will always be the elder brother to Inaaya, protective about her.”

"Being an actor is not just about facing the camera anymore. Besides their work hours on sets, stars have brand endorsements to think about and events to attend. Hence, efficient use of time is a must, especially when you are someone like Kareena Kapoor Khan, who is also mom to one-year-old Taimur.

And recently, at the shoot of a commercial, the actress proved that she is a pro at managing time. Says a source, “Bebo had allotted six hours of her time for the ad shoot of an apparel brand that she endorses. There were outfit changes required for almost every shot and photograph.”

And while make-up and costume can take a lot of time, the actress wrapped up the shoot at lightning speed. “Kareena managed to finish 14 changes in just two hours. Everyone on the sets was impressed with the pace at which she completed her job and the way she handled everything,” adds a source from the team of the brand. With the shoot wrapped up in a little over two hours, the crew was happy to head home early.",entertainment,http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-kareena-kapoor-khan-manages-14-changes-in-2-hours-2609309
"Taimur Ali Khan with his nanny Savatri during an outing in Bandra, Mumbai. Taimur looked extremely adorable in a red shirt with white stripes and shorts. Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's tiny tot, who turned one on December 20 last year is already a social media sensation. His photographs are constantly going viral online. Pics/Yogen Shah

Kareena Kapoor Khan revealed at an event in March that son Taimur Ali Khan was initially meant to be named Faiz. In a conversation with journalist Rajdeep Sardesai, she was asked if too much of media scrutiny spoils their private life, especially after how the social media trolled her son's name. Kareena said: ""Of course, there was trolling but at the same time there was an immense support from the people we were getting, not that trolls matter to us that much but it was our choice""

Did you know? Kareena Kapoor Khan lovingly refers to son Taimur as 'Little John'. After Saif and Kareena announced their son's name as Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, Twitterati went on to troll the couple and the baby's name. They questioned why they named their son after 'the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur'. To this veteran Bollywood actor and Kareena's uncle Rishi Kapoor lashed out at the trolls and was even joined by Karan Johar

Taimur (or Timur) (who Saif-Kareena's son is named after) translates to 'iron'. He was a 14th century Turco-Mongol ruler and Mughal dynasty founder, Babur's ancestor. His ambition was to rebuild the empire of Genghis Khan, who had died a century prior, and his conquests included large parts of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Syria, and Delhi. A promoter of arts and literature, he is behind the stunning city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan

October actor Varun Dhawan, who turned 31 on April 24, shared a hilarious meme on Instagram, in which, Varun and Taimur Ali Khan are conversing about former's age. The post reads, ""Varun: Taimur, tumhe pata hai mai 31 years ka ho gaya? (Taimur, do you know that I am 31 years old now?). Taimur: Lekin Varun bhaiya, mujhe toh aap meri age ke lagte ho. (But brother Varun, you look my age)""

At a recent awards function earlier this month, Kareena Kapoor Khan was seen jesting with Akshay Kumar, wherein, she joked about her 1-year old son, Taimur Ali Khan being a threat to the actor. In the video, which has now gone viral, she is seen saying, ""Akshay (actor Akshay Kumar), Taimur is a threat to you, I am telling you""

Kareena Kapoor was also seen saying the actor, who was sitting in the audience, about how Taimur would undoubtedly beat him at the Box Office if their films ever released together. ""Even in your fan following, he can surpass you. It's an open challenge,"" told the 37-year-old actress to Akshay Kumar

Saif Ali Khan and Kareena's son Taimur is very popular. It wouldn't be wrong to say that he enjoys as much popularity as his celebrity parents. Talking about the limelight he gets, momma Kareena says that it is ""scary"". She also said that when the time comes, she would like Taimur to get a chance to prove himself

Taimur Ali Khan has several dedicated fan clubs to his name. They religiously keep sharing pictures of the munchkin's visit to the play school, poolside garden or just chilling in his balcony's swing. In fact, Taimur's nanny Savatri too has her own fan following on social media! Several parody accounts on platforms like Facebook and Instagram exist in her name",entertainment,https://www.mid-day.com/photos/could-taimur-ali-khan-be-the-cutest-bollywood-star-kid/16687

"Alia Bhatt is going to dazzle us once more with Meghana Gulzar’s Raazi and yet again, she would leave us speechless and wanting for more with her intense AF performance. For those who don’t know, Alia will play the title role of Sehmat who is a spy sent to Pakistan in a garb of a new bride to a decorated army officer, played by Vicky Kaushal. In an exclusive interview with Bollywood Hungama, Amruta Khanvilkar who is Alia Bhatt’s co-star in the film opens about how her role carries the story forward and complements Alia’s character.

While talking about her character she said that though she cannot talk much about her role in the film at this stage, but assured us that it is very special to the main plot and beautifully takes Sehmat’s brave endeavour forward. Amruta revealed, “I play a very strong, Pakistani girl. It was very different for me to portray this character because I had to get used to speaking Urdu language and the whole leheja of a Pakistani girl. I had not played anything like this before.” She also added that she would be playing Vicky Kaushal’s sister in law and is the badi bahu of the house Alia would be marrying into. As her constant companion, Amrita supports Alia, albeit unknowingly, through her mission and helps a lot to get acclimatised to the house and its people. And this is not it! Amruta signed off by revealing one more key detail. Alia’s only emotional track with a woman is with her but it comes much later in the movie. Now, if this does not get you excited about Raazi, what else will?

Apart from catching in an emotional, action filled role we will also see her sizzling chemistry with Vicky. The film will be out on May 11.

"Modern bridal elegance, thy name is Alia Bhatt.

With her hair neatly tied in a bun and make-up done in soft pink tones that glowed almost as much as her twinkling ensembles in soft pastels, the bridal looks the actor wears, as Indian spy Sehmat Khan in her upcoming film Raazi, can only be described as stunning.

Have you ever imagined what Alia’s wedding ensemble might look like? Well, thanks to Raazi’s new song Dilbaro, you don’t have to. The song (watch above) was released on Thursday and shows Alia leaving her parent’s house (played by actors Rajit Kapoor and Soni Razdan) after marrying a Pakistani army officer (Vicky Kaushal). In the emotive and sensitive song, bride Alia wears two beautiful ensembles — a sublime baby pink saree worn with a pale blue dupatta-cum-veil and a sumptuous all-over embellished gharara (wide-legged pants) set.

The embellished design of her gharara set flattered Alia’s petite silhouette. (Youtube grab)

Since Raazi is set around the 1971 war between India and Pakistan, the Dilbaro song sees an impeccably-clad Alia channelling vintage-inspired bridal style through a modern lens. While the embellished design of her gharara set flattered the star’s petite silhouette, a traditional mangtika, ornate pearl and gold necklace set and a large nose ring made Alia’s look more authentic, while accentuating her milky complexion and natural beauty. Alia wore a smouldering smoky eye and a pretty pink pout for a soft yet seductive look.

Dare to be the bride who eschews wedding outfit traditions in the family and doesn’t wear a presumed lehenga/ saree to her wedding? If you want to take on this challenge, you should follow in Alia’s footsteps and consider the gharara option. Whether you choose a heavy overlay made of heavy embellishments or delicate tulle with embroidered flowers, the unexpected gharara-choli-dupatta combo will send the message that you’re confident and adventurous in your big day fashion choices.

Such a look works well for those who want a more modest wedding look. (Youtube grab)

Now that you’re going with a poufy gharara for the main wedding ceremony, Alia’s saree look ahead will be perfect for the reception or engagement ceremony. At a time when super-embellished gowns and lehengas that makes you feel like a princess or queen are the norm for a reception look, brides not afraid to go outside the box and those who aren’t particularly worried about what others think will love this pale bridal look.

The pastel shades of light blue and pink lend that feminine air to Alia’s wide border drape with a hint of intricate embroidery. Her pastel pink stained lips and glowy bronze eye shadow were elegant without being stuffy.

Alia’s sublime baby pink saree worn with a pale blue dupatta-cum-veil is perfect for a summer bride. (Youtube grab)

Wearing a sweet pale blue net dupatta, featuring an embellished border and scattered sequin, as veil amplified Alia’s saree’s beauty tenfold. Such a look works well for those who want a more modest wedding look. Make no mistake, though, if you want to go the sexy route, simply opt for an embellished sheer or floral saree and a barely-there blouse instead.

So, keep these two Alia looks handy the next time you’re shopping for a wedding look. To make things a little easy for you, we found similar styles that you can shop right now:

"Raazi Song Ae Watan: Alia Bhatt's Journey as a spy is Perfectly Showcased in this Beautiful Number by Arijit Singh

The first song from Raazi titled Ae Watan is out (Photo Credits: YouTube)

The first song from Alia Bhatt's much awaited film Raazi is finally here and it is just SPECTACULAR! The song perfectly showcases Alia Bhatt's journey from an ordinary girl to an extraordinary spy. It shows how Sehmat sacrifices her safety for her country and overcomes all hurdles that come her way to protect her nation. This is the first time Arijit Singh has sung a patriotic number. He has felt each and every word like he means it and we don't think anyone else apart from him could have sung this so as beautifully as Arijit.

The posters and trailer of Alia Bhatt and Vicky Kaushal's Raazi have already gotten fans pretty excited. Alia plays an Indian spy in the film who gets married to a Pakistani major. The makers have released the first song from the movie and Arijit Singh's first patriotic number, Ae Watan. Alia had already given us a glimpse of the song at an event and we loved it. Now that the song is finally out, we can't stop listening to it on a loop. It's definitely one of the best songs this year and Arijit is like a magician who will make you listen to it throughout the day.

Check out the video of Ae Watan from Raazi right here:

At the song launch, Alia was asked about how she prepped for the role of a spy. To which she said, ""I had to memorize codes but I don't know how much of it is shown. All the technical ones. Eventually I was happy that I learnt it because I was always in character. Learnt how to ride a jonga (check spelling. It's a truck of some sort) I have also learnt Urdu, to get the diction right. I watched Kabhie Kabhie, Silsila and all."" We are looking forward to Alia and Vicky's chemistry in the film as they are starring opposite each other for the first time. The film is set to release on May 11, 2018.",entertainment,https://www.latestly.com/entertainment/bollywood/raazi-song-ae-watan-alia-bhatts-journey-as-a-spy-is-perfectly-showcased-in-this-beautiful-number-by-arijit-singh-118264.html
"Harshdeep Kaur has crooned Raazi song Dilbaro starring Alia Bhatt. Harshdeep Kaur has crooned Raazi song Dilbaro starring Alia Bhatt.

The makers of Raazi on Thursday released the second song from the film titled Dilbaro. The song has been composed by Shankar Eshaan Loy, written by Gulzar and sung by the very talented playback singer Harshdeep Kaur. In an exclusive interview with indianexpress.com, Harshdeep talks about Dilbaro, Alia Bhatt, Gulzar and last but not the least, Shankar Ehsaan Loy.

Dilbaro is a song about the father and daughter bond. What sort of bond do you share with your father?

People come to me and tell me about my bond with my father. They tell me we look like best friends. He was the one who discovered my talent and he has taken me to places, be it recordings or shows. Even now, he travels with me on my tours. He encourages me. He taught me basics of music.

We are more like friends. We discuss everything with each other. I am his ‘laadli’. Our bond is so popular that if someone asks me how I am, the next question has to be about my father.

What is your understanding of the term Dilbaro?

Dilbaro means beloved. It can be anybody. In the song, it is the father.

Did Dilbaro remind you of the moment when you were leaving your parents’ house and heading towards a new life?

During my bidaai ceremony, jab end me rona-dhona hota hai and everybody comes and bids goodbye to you. At that moment, I was looking for my dad. It was a very emotional moment. I did not want anyone but him. That particular moment always makes me emotional. The song automatically took me back to the moment. When I read the lyrics and heard the song, I was reliving my bidaai moment, which helped me to emote in the song.

Also read| Music Review: Raazi

It’s an emotional song. What was your first reaction to it?

Shankarji called me. He asked me if I can record a song. He wanted to check my scale at first so he hummed the song. He did not sing lyrics but only the tune. The tune was so melodious. When I went to the studio and read the lyrics, I was blown away.

Also, certain tunes have become rare these days. It is a beautiful composition and it’s there to stay forever. It will be the bidaai anthem. I felt the song was made for me only.

This is yet again a composition of Gulzar who wrote your hit track Heer too. Do you expect Dilbaro to become yet another hit of your career?

Yes, of course. This is my first duet with Shankarji. He has taken the song to another level.

For me, tune of the song is supreme and then comes the lyrics. Tune is the king. If tune is not good, the song might fail. Dilbaro gives you goosebumps and it will definitely match up to Heer (Jab Tak Hai Jaan) level.

Are you a fan of Gulzar like all of us?

I absolutely love Gulzar sahab. It is an honour for me to sing his lyrics. I am extra conscious when I sing his composition because I do not want to mess up the pronunciations. The way he describes, it is so visual. It is a regular bidaai song but it stays true to the concept of the film. Like when she sings “Dehleej paar karade”, she also means that she is going to some other country as a spy. It has deep meaning to it. Gulzar sahab is a master in bringing emotions with so much ease.

Also read| Raazi song Dilbaro: The Harshdeep Kaur track gives words to the special father-daughter bond

As a singer, did you get the liberty to give your inputs?

Collaborating with Shankarji is too much fun. He teaches you the song. I am very particular about things. So, if he would sing thrice, I would ask him to sing 10 more times. He would make me sing entire song in one go even if I make mistakes. You keep singing the song till you master it.

He keeps praising you, encouraging you and motivates you to do better. As he himself is a singer, he knows the stress a singer goes through to deliver the best. The recording process is very natural with him.

Dilbaro is picturised on Alia Bhatt. Do you think she did a good job?

Alia Bhatt is a treat to watch on screen. She is the best actor of the present lot. Her eyes do the talking. She is such a powerful actor that she does not need to deliver dialogues. Her expressions are enough. She looks so beautiful.

Since we are experiencing a time when regional cinema and songs are becoming popular across India, is there a language or genre you want to explore?

I enjoy music. Language is not a barrier. I do not have a particular reason to why I would choose a different language. I enjoy the beauty of it and the process of learning the language and the culture. Yes, I would love to sing in Bengali. I have done a few songs but would like to explore more. Same goes for Tamil.

What’s next for Harshdeep Kaur fans?

I am working on my singles right now. Bollywood music has always been my first love because in India, it is the biggest platform with huge reach but sometimes, there is a certain kind of music you want to present to the audience. So that I am doing with my independent music. I do a lot of concerts, which is a different experience altogether.

Any message for fans/music lovers?

The kind of music releasing these days, I think we don’t care about what we are giving to the audience. Earlier, there was quality. It should not fade away. As listeners, we have responsibility to give ourselves and our future some good music to cherish.

Encourage good music, poetry and lyrics.

"Director Vijay's recently released film comes across as a half-baked, confusing at times, bothering take on the whole issue of abortion. Diya opens with 18-year-old Thulasi (Sai Pallavi) and Krishna (Naga Shourya) getting bashed by their respective parents. Thulasi is pregnant. Though the parents are 'okay' with them getting married after five years, they want to get rid of the baby. Thulasi wants the child. But they win.

After five years, the couple ties the knot, but Thulasi, now a doctor, is not over her unborn child. She makes sketches of her imaginary child and names her Diya. But Diya doesn't exist just in her notebook, she is now a five-year-old ghost who is on a mission to avenge her death.

For the audience who happily lapped up a housefly taking revenge (SS Rajamoul's Naan E), Diya's plot is not so unsatisfactory. But the film is. Vijay's Diya reiterates that just an innovative idea isn't good enough for making a good film.

Except for the core premise, there is nothing new in Vijay's film. The murders committed by the cute little ghost serve as a metaphor for abortion: every victim dies out of asphyxiation and most of them die in a concealed environment. But these aren't good enough, especially when the audience keeps predicting the next scene. Even the short runtime of Diya doesn't help.

Coming back to the moralistic stand that Diya takes, one is bound to be a bit taken back when the film ends with a title card that says Diya could have been a Kalpana Chawla or an Indira Gandhi had she been allowed to live. It is also accompanied by statistics; of how many women undergo abortion every year in India.

This begs a series of questions. How many of those abortions were due to problems like rape or underage pregnancy? Thulasi was forced into abortion, but what about those women who volunteer for it? What about choice?

Diya is not clear in answering them, and Vijay is not lucid in saying whether his film is against forced abortion or abortion on the whole. If it is the latter, then the film is problematic.

The film that has been acted for release since long has finally seen the light of day.Starring Naga Shaurya Sai Pallavi and Veronika Arora in lead roles, the film charts the journey of the newly married couple Krishna (Naga Shaurya) and Tulasi (Sai Pallavi). Lovers since they were teenagers, Krishna is eager and happy to have married Tulasi after a wait of five years. Tulasi however seems to be stuck in the past, to an incident that changed her life forever. While their marriage seems complicated in itself, with the couple trying hard to put the past behind them and make it work, they have a third wheel, an unseen entity, not making it any easier for them.The first half sees Priyadarshi play the role of SI Agni, a cowardly officer obsessed with food and Bigg Boss. Unlike him, his constables however are playing close attention to all the mysterious deaths that surround the couple, especially Tulasi. 'Kanam' has so far been a predictable yet engaging ride, with all the deaths playing out with an innovativeness reminiscent of 'Final Destination'. However, the film does drag on a bit in the first half when it gets a tad bit repetitive.With all the cards laid out right before the interval, it remains to be seen if 'Kanam' has any surprises in store in the second half.Watch this space for full review of movie 'Kanam'.",entertainment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/kanam-movie-review-highlights-a-predictable-yet-engaging-ride-so-far/articleshow/63936795.cms
"Diya

Director: Vijay

Cast: Sai Pallavi, Naga Shaurya, Veronica

Rating: 1.5

A teenaged girl aborts her baby and spends the rest of her life haunted by -- literally -- who the foetus would have grown into. The premise itself is interesting -- tried earlier yet interesting still -- but needs careful and expert handling for audience expects chills and thrills while ensuring the sensitive story gets its due climax.

To return to director Vijay’s Diya, starring Sai Pallavi, Naga Shaurya and baby Veronica, we meet the young couple Thulasi and Krishna, who have just finished school and are spending some carefree time before they enter college. The couple is in love and soon realise they are pregnant. Not ready for this responsibility, they decide to abort the foetus. If you thought this was a spoiler, it isn’t.

In fact, the director is in no mood to keep this a suspense in the film. We see the couple eventually tie the knot, but happiness evades Thulasi. She still remembers her unborn child and grieves her loss. It is five years since that moment, but as Thulasi tells Krishna, “You could have forgotten what happened, but I cannot.”

The audience is left to assume the reason why Diya manifests as a ghost. There is no clear answer as to why she decides to take revenge on the couple five years after abortion. The fact that this is a revenge by the unborn child, who is now 5-year-old is also not a surprise. It is presented in a matter-of-fact manner.

While the theme is interesting, we are left wondering where does this film stand on the pro-choice vs pro-life debate? Isn’t it even a little weird to pick an abortion that was done for the sake of a better future for two individuals, either of whom was ill-equipped to handle a baby? Even more uncomfortable was the fact that Thulasi herself is studying to become a doctor.

In this same space, there was an opportunity to explore ideas like postnatal care, depression, or personality disorder. In fact, RJ Balaji, who plays the role of a policeman who is afraid of death and dead bodies, suddenly begins to take interest in a series of murders in connection with Thulasi. At this point, we start to expect a twist somewhere because what else would drive the horror movie until the end if not suspense. Right? Well, wrong. There are no twists and certainly, no scares in this horror film.

The director has tried to make the audience feel what the loss of an unborn child entails. He has tried to put forth the point that the couple chose to abort ‘the girl who could have been another Indira Gandhi or Kalpana Chawla’. My only question is, shouldn’t then the abortion itself have been related to the gender of the foetus, like the film Aval that picked on abortion in relation to female foeticide? In Diya, the couple or their relative who decide to go ahead with the abortion do not know the gender of the foetus. The choice is made by the family as the teenagers are clearly unequipped to bring up a baby.

The movie was initially named Karu, which is apt for the subject of the film. In Tamil, Karu is a foetus that is gender neutral.

The sole takeaway from this movie is Sai Pallavi’s acting. There is specifically one scene -- a close up shot of Sai Pallavi’s face with no dialogues and the camera focuses just on her expression. She nails the happy-sad feeling beautifully in this shot. Naga Shaurya, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to be very comfortable in the character’s skin. For instance, if one were really confused about their wife’s mental health, there has to be some worry. Naga Shaurya as Krish has made a wobbly debut.

Speaking about the cinematography by Nirav Shah, a particular car accident shot in a 360-degree angle stands out for all the wrong reasons. It feels more like the character was a part of a video game in this scene. Special effects itself is not up to mark in this film.

Sam CS’s music has added much value to the film, the background score especially is haunting, which is exactly the feeling the film was aiming for but can never achieve.

"New Delhi:

On April 1, best-selling author Chetan Bhagat put out this tweet, “Couldn’t take it anymore. The country needs to be fixed. Joining Congress. Will be supporting their Karnataka campaign. With RG, let’s make a better India,” As many Twitter users fell for Mr Bhagat’s April Fools’ Day prank, the tweet received over 2,000 ‘likes’ and 1,000 responses in just a couple of hours.

The 44-year-old author, whose novels about young, urban, middle class India like ‘Half Girlfriend’ and ‘Five Point Someone’ won him a huge following, was seen as firmly in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s corner since he came to power in 2014. But of late, less than a year ahead of the 2019 general elections, the author and columnist has been critical of PM Modi and his party. Earlier this month, Mr Bhagat used his Twitter handle to conduct a dipstick survey asking users to rate the performance of PM Modi’s government.



Over 38k votes in this twitter poll. 58% believe Modi govt performance below expectations, many even calling it well below. somewhat unusual Twitter result where Modi supporters outnumber others. https://t.co/Dq9Djltg4u — Chetan Bhagat (@chetan_bhagat) April 18, 2018

“I was one of the early ones to predict PM Modi’s win, now we are facing a new election and everything is up for grabs again. It’s not such a slam dunk. This is not me taking sides, this is reality,” he told NDTV.

Just before Narendra Modi was elected as Prime Minister of the country in 2014, he had posted a selfie with Chetan Bhagat, wishing him on his 40th birthday.

Mr Bhagat, an alumnus of IIM-Ahmedabad, recently wrote a column titled “Indian youth don’t just want to be pakoda wallahs”. The author was taking a dig at PM Modi’s comment in January this year when he said a person earning Rs. 200 a day selling pakoda is also employed.

But he insists he isn’t taking sides. “My job is to hold a mirror to society, what the mirror shows is what is shows,” he said.

Mr Bhagat, who doesn’t shy away from expressing his thoughts on various issues, offered his opinion on the recent spate rapes cases being reported. “We need to have a broader discussion on sex and how much of a say women have in this country. Till that changes, these things will keep happening,” he said.

On the government’s move to amend the law to introduce death penalty for rape of minors under 12 years of age, the author said, “A 360 degree approach is needed to solve this and one announcement won’t do it, even if it may help.”",entertainment,http://www.independentrecorder.com/chetan-bhagats-own-poll-on-pm-modi-says-2019-no-slam-dunk-for-bjp-78782.html
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge already had used the name when they named their first child. (Photo: AP)

Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate have named their baby son Louis Arthur Charles, Kensington Palace announced on Friday.

""The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles,"" said a palace statement. ""The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge."" He is now fifth in line to the throne.

Here are 10 things we know about the name:

Not a popular name in England and Wales: According to the ONS data, over recent years Louis has been hovering between being the 70th and 80th most popular boys names for new babies.

Surprise choice: Most pundits and bookmakers had made Arthur or Albert the firm favourite to be picked – with Louis an outside bet.

Louis has borrowed it from his brother: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge already had used the name when they named their first child. Prince George, third in line to the throne, has the full given name of George Alexander Louis.

Blackpool zoo names someone Louis as well: Blackpool zoo had a baby camel calf born on the same day as the new prince, and wasted no time giving it the same name. The animal is cute, so we can just about forgive them.

It’s a French name and the French had 18 kings named Louis: The French monarchy were historically very keen on the name Louis, and ended up with 18 monarchs bearing that name. In fact, for 186 years between 1610 and 1798, every king was called Louis.

The 19th King Louis of France ruled for about 20 minutes before abdicating in 1830. His father, Charles X, had given up the throne that day during the Second French Revolution, and Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, clearly saw which way the political wind was blowing.

Meaning in French: The Frankish roots of the name are said to derive from the words for fame and warrior, and its original form was Hlōdowik. The English derivatives have become Louis and Lewis, with the name becoming Ludwig in the Germanic tongue.

The English did have a King Louis for a while: He doesn’t feature in the Horrible Histories Kings and Queens song – but Louis VIII of France spent some time in England cavorting around as king, even having a proclamation of it at St Paul’s Cathedral. He was being preferred as ruler by the barons who despised King John. However, having landed at Thanet in 1216, Louis was removed from the throne when King John died, and the barons decided it was easier to deal with making his nine-year-old son King Henry III than carry on working with the Frenchman.

In 1217 the treaty of Lambeth was signed, and Louis was paid 10,000 marks on the condition that he accepted he had never been the legitimate King of England.

It has a family tie for Prince William: There’s a closer personal link for the present-day royal family. The last prominent British royal names Louis was Louis Mountbatten, the great-grandson of Queen Victoria and uncle to Prince Philip.",entertainment,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/viral-and-trending/280418/prince-william-and-kate-name-baby-louis-8-things-about-name.html

So, in keeping with tradition, when Queen Margrethe II succeeded the throne after her father King Frederik IX’s passing in 1972, and married French diplomat Count Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, she named her first child Prince Frederik. However, the Queen broke with tradition when she named her second son Prince Joachim. Prince Frederik, on the other hand, has carried on the tradition, naming his first child Christian, after his wedding to Mary Donaldson in 2004.

"With the news of the new royal baby, many are wondering about the dynamics of the now family of five. Prince William and Kate Middleton now have 4-year-old Prince George, soon-to-be-3-year-old Princess Charlotte, and a newborn son. A first born royal is met with a tremendous amount of adulation and circumstance — after all, he or she could be the future King or Queen. Not to say that subsequent siblings are not met with celebration, but certainly the excitement is ever so slightly less intense. One has to wonder how those dynamics form the people these — and all — children will become. Could being (and not being) the first born child really have that great an effect your personality, success and destiny?

Certainly Prince William and Prince Harry seem to demonstrate that common archetype, the first born being the more level-headed and mature, with the second born often seen as the more mischievous, rebellious and relaxed one. But will such trends continue for the new regal trio? And what do those often-heard myths mean for families who don't wear any crowns - does birth order really affect one's life?

U.S. Presidents and early astronauts are overwhelmingly first born children, which only seems to lend credence to the theory; these facts are pure happenstance and don't really make a convincing connection. But more recent research, aimed at finding a more meaningful connection, has shed new light on interesting birth order trends. A 2015 study collected data on over 20,000 participants in the U.S., UK and Germany, only involving families that contained two and three siblings (excluding twins). After running personality tests, the researchers found no correlation between traits like extraversion, emotional stability and agreeableness and birthing order. However, the same study found a noticeably stronger link between birth order and intelligence; the first born child was often the most intelligent, a trend that decreased with each subsequent child. The purported theory here was that with the first born child parents have more resources and greater interest in how they raise the child, better priming them for success in the world and affording them the ability to attain greater overall intelligence. Furthermore, the study showed that this trend was consistent in self-reported levels of intelligence too, meaning each child was aware of, and had internalized, their respective levels of intelligence.

While intelligence does not necessarily equal success, not being the first born has been shown to potentially have some tangibly negative consequences too. A 2017 paper examined data from both Denmark and Florida to find that while second born children seem no less healthy, nor do they attend worse schools, compared to the first born children, second born siblings are more likely to have been suspended from school, spent time dealing with the juvenile justice system, been involved in violent crimes and, in Denmark only, are more likely to have spent time in prison before the age of 21. Again, researchers examined differences in parenting dynamics and the most significant statistic they found was that mothers seem to return to work earlier with their second born (before they are 4-years-old) than with their first born. Surely this statistic cannot account for all the trends, but it illuminates the different potential upbringing dynamics a child can face.

Each child enters their family at a different stage, under their own unique circumstances, not to mention differences in areas like gender, economic status, living arrangements and lifestyle. To borrow a concept from Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point; social cause and effect is not necessarily one-to-one (""My life turned out this way because my mother went back to work before I was four.""), but the culmination of a number of factors, personal influences and potential outcomes that meld together to cause similar behaviours in a great number of people serve as a possible explanation for the creation of stigmas and archetypal behaviours around first, second and third-born children.

So, what about Charlotte? While Prince George will always be the first born, she is now no longer the baby of the family; the dynamic of her upbringing and identification has significantly changed, and it's not hard to see why the ""middle child syndrome"" is possible. Dr. Kevin Leman examined these archetypes in the best-selling The Birth Order Book: Why You Are The Way You Are, in which he characterized patterns he found in his studies of birth orders. The first born (also applicable to an only child, even more so), can be seen as perfectionist leaders, often aggressively seeking approval from those above them. The middle born can reflect opposite traits from what they see in the first born, as well as developing secretive tendencies, as well as feeling ignored in favour of the new baby, though they have the ability to mediate between the oldest and youngest siblings. The third born is seen as extroverted and charming but financially reckless, with the ability to get away with anything. While these child types are somewhat controversial given the complexity of evolving family dynamics and conflicting studies, they are still concepts that many people subscribe and attest to, believing they should be aware of and ""parented around"" during the upbringing process.

So will Prince George be a perfectionist, with the new baby being financially irresponsible, leaving Princess Charlotte to seek peace between the two? Maybe, maybe not. But as we watch these majestic lives unfold in front of us, as different as they are, there's sure to be some sibling moments and behaviours we know all too well.",entertainment,http://www.cbc.ca/life/wellness/will-kate-plus-3-what-the-new-royal-baby-can-tell-us-about-sibling-destiny-1.4637265

"With ‘Kabali’, Rajinikanth employed style as a weapon of empowerment.

Some 93 minutes, 30 seconds into K. Balachander’s love quadrangle Aboorva Raagangal (1975), an unkempt-looking man in a loose tie, untucked shirt and worn-out jacket dramatically pushes open the gate and makes his first onscreen appearance.

The film, divided into chapters, kicked off a new one with that shot. The entry was announced by a title card, “Sruthi Bedham” (scale change). Indeed, the scale had changed.

For with that low-angle long shot, a former bus conductor made the most important entry in the history of Tamil cinema. Someone who would go on to sell billions of tickets.

A dark-skinned outcast of an anti-hero had sneaked into a world of showbiz that had been reserved for the fair-skinned because the good old movie camera preferred it that way.

Though he started off playing variations of grey and all-out dark roles—an alcoholic in Aboorva Raagangal, a village bully who attempts rape in 16 Vayathanile, a rapist in Moondru Mudichu—Rajinikanth cemented his position as a serious actor with complex character roles in movies such as Bhuvana Oru Kelvikkuri, Avargal, Aarilirindhu Aruvathu Varai and Netrikkan before he starred in remakes of Amitabh Bachchan films. Billa, for instance, was a remake of Don, Velaikkaaran of Namak Halaal, Thee of Deewaar, and Panakkaran of Laawaris, to name a few. All these films channelled the rage of the angry young man in the southern context.

Towards the end of the 1980s and all through the 1990s, Rajinikanth evolved into the quintessential south Indian chauvinist hero who wore the uniform of the working classes (taxi driver in Padikkathavan, auto-driver in Baasha, milkman in Annamalai, factory worker in Uzhaippali) and rose to become the undisputed “superstar”, influential enough to change governments. His famous, “Even God cannot save Tamil Nadu”, is said to have cost the late J. Jayalalithaa the election in 1996.

Political attacks on his smoking and drinking onscreen meant he had to take responsibility for setting right the wrongs of his cinematic career—he gave up the very cigarette that defined his style and persona on screen. Over the last decade and a half, we have seen the evolution of a family-friendly superstar. Like a James Bond you wouldn’t mind introducing your sister to. The cigarette was replaced by a biscuit. But the style remained—the way he would flip his sunglasses, the swagger, the way he would run his hands through his hair.

Any rare attempt to move away from what people expected bombed. Case in point, Baba (2002), a masala-meets-spirituality film he had written himself.

After the twin box-office failures of the animated mythological Kochadaiiyaan and the generic revenge drama Lingaa (both in 2014), Pa. Ranjith, a Generation Next writer-director of the highly acclaimed sociopolitical drama Madras (2014), was given charge of reinventing the Rajinikanth brand.

Until Kabali (2016), Rajinikanth, now 67, had fought shy of playing his age. He had played older characters earlier in his career, including saint Sree Raaghavendar in his 100th film of the same name in 1985, but the trappings of superstardom—and market forces—compelled him into an image trap over the later, post-1985, part of his career.

With Kabali, Rajinikanth employed style as a weapon of empowerment.

In the film, the director’s voice rings loud and clear: He makes his hero read Y.B. Satyanarayana’s My Father Baliah (a book on what it means to be a Dalit in India) and drops enough clues through the film about Kabali’s Dalit identity. For this champion of the masses defies the bad guys by wearing their uniform—the “coat-suit”.

The dark-skinned hero had come a long way from the time he wore the uniforms of auto-drivers, milk vendors, factory workers and taxi drivers.

The film’s punchline, translated, goes somewhat like this: “If you think my prosperity is a problem, I will prosper, da. I will wear coat-suit, da. Will put one leg over the other, and sit in style, in front of you. If you can’t deal with it, die.”

Despite mixed reviews, Ranjith ensured a somewhat smooth transition, enabling the superstar to embrace his “greys” in the movies—almost two decades after Bachchan had made that transition on screen.

Critics and the masses loved the fact that Rajinikanth was now ageing gracefully. Kabali was the superstar’s first hit in six years, since director Shankar’s 2010 sci-fi action bilingual Enthiran (Robot).

This may explain why Ranjith got a second shot at directing the actor in the forthcoming Kaala. It’s another sociopolitical drama, this one is set in the slums of Dharavi in Mumbai.

Rajinikanth signed Kaala well before he announced his entry into politics, but fans are keen to see if the film reflects his cinema of the early 1990s, with punchlines alluding to a possible entry into politics. They may not translate well and you might have to read them with a straight face: “Nobody knows how I’ll come, when I’ll come but when I have to come, I’ll come” (Muthu, 1995); or “My way, unique way” (Padaiyappa, 1999); or “Or God ordains, Arunachalam completes” (Arunachalam, 1999).

Ranjith, a Chennai-based Dalit film-maker, has sympathy for the marginalized but sociopolitical films don’t always translate into box-office success. Understandably, then, the film-maker is under pressure to measure every word he puts out there. When contacted for this story, he preferred to have the questions sent to him so that he could take his time with the answers.

Rajnikanth started his career with Tamil cinema’s Billy Wilder, K. Balachander, but went on to work with film-maker S.P. Muthuraman for almost half his career before he began working with Suresh Krissna, P. Vasu, K.S. Ravikumar, and, ultimately, Shankar, who delivered a superhit with Sivaji (2007). Shankar signed the actor for Enthiran (Robot). Critics observed that if Sivaji was Shankar doing a Rajinikanth film, Enthiran (Robot) was Rajinikanth doing a Shankar film.

I ask Ranjith if he had managed to get the superstar to do a Pa. Ranjith film. The response is diplomatic: “It is amazing how these thoughts or discussions never came up in the conversations between Rajini Sir and me,” he wrote on WhatsApp.

“He saw my work in Madras and called me. From my debut feature, all the films I have made so far are story-specific. So, when Rajini Sir and I met, we knew exactly what to expect of each other. That’s how we delivered Kabali. After Kabali, Kaala became possible also for the same reasons. He liked my work and believed that I can deliver something interesting yet again.

“When we first met to speak about Kaala, Sir was keen on making a commercial film.

“When I went back to him with the story of Kaala, the commercial element and the sociopolitical aspect in the story excited him,” writes Ranjith.

On 31 December (Kaala was still in the making), Rajinikanth announced that he would enter politics and contest all 234 seats in the 2021 elections, finally setting to rest all the speculation.

Was the script changed or tweaked keeping in mind Rajinikanth’s political ambitions? “When we were shooting Kaala, his political entry was not final,” clarifies Ranjith. “Nothing in my stories changed and Rajini Sir is also a person who does not expect these things. He does not in any way interfere in the story or ask for things to be changed.”

Rajini Sir is a superhuman to the audience. My stories have protagonists who are superhuman in day-to-day life because of the conviction, goodwill and sense of justice they exhibit. When these two elements combine on screen, it makes for magic.- Pa. Ranjith

While Ranjith’s anti-caste cinema bats for the downtrodden, Rajinikanth’s politics has a hint of spirituality. His faith in God (and religion) is well-documented and part of his political rhetoric. I’m curious about how the twain meet.

Ranjith explains: “Rajini Sir is a superhuman to the audience. My stories have protagonists who are superhuman in day-to-day life because of the conviction, goodwill and sense of justice they exhibit. When these two elements combine on screen, it makes for magic. We have tried creating that in Kaala. People will relate to the character Kaala and his journey of conviction, and that is the only influence this film wants to have on its audience.”

As the teaser indicates, Rajinikanth plays Karikaalan from Tirunelveli, the protector who fights for the poor (Tamils in Dharavi in this case, as opposed to Tamils in Malaysia in Kabali). He celebrates all things black—he is dressed in black, with matching dark shades. When a white shirt-sporting Nana Patekar, presumably a politician, says,“I want to make this country clean…and pure,” the superstar shoots back: “Black…is the colour of hard work. Come to my chawl and you will see dirt turn into colour.” If most mainstream cinema has been about good versus evil, depicted in white versus black, respectively, Kaala’s teaser tries to make a case for black as the colour of the hard-working poor and white as schemingly evil.

This isn’t the first film where Rajinikanth is playing the protector of the poor in Mumbai. One of the most iconic Rajinikanth films, Baasha (1995), a loose reworking of Mukul Anand’s Hum (1991), featured Rajinikanth playing a godfather-figure, posing with a Great Dane for the posters.

Twenty-three years later, Rajinikanth is back in Mumbai. This time, not in rich man’s clothes (as he did in Kabali or Baasha), or posing with a foreign- pedigree canine. He’s in a black kurta and black lungi, with a stray for company.

Ranjith insists the subversion wasn’t intentional. The stray in Kaala’s poster is a character in the film. “I wanted the character Kaala to have a stray as a companion in the film. I did not intend it as a comparison or as a tribute in any way,” the director clarifies.

It’s only fitting, though, that the cinema of Ranjith celebrates the stray rather than conforming to conventional notions of pedigree or race.

It’s easy to see why Rajinikanth the superstar would say yes to Kaala. He has owned the black identity, and has associated the colour with style. There’s a whole sequence in Shankar’s Sivaji that celebrates black skin, including the song Oru Koodai Sunlight, where the visual effects team creates a white Rajinikanth to prove why it just wouldn’t be the same.

It’s a colour he was chosen to play in his debut film, as an abusive alcoholic. Today, it’s the colour of a champion. A hero.

On 7 June, we will find out if Kaala does for Dalits what Marvel’s Black Panther—the third-highest grossing blockbuster and the highest-grossing superhero movie of all time in the US—did for black people. Become a milestone film celebrating the Dalit identity.

"With ‘Kabali’, Rajinikanth employed style as a weapon of empowerment.

Some 93 minutes, 30 seconds into K. Balachander’s love quadrangle Aboorva Raagangal (1975), an unkempt-looking man in a loose tie, untucked shirt and worn-out jacket dramatically pushes open the gate and makes his first onscreen appearance.

The film, divided into chapters, kicked off a new one with that shot. The entry was announced by a title card, “Sruthi Bedham” (scale change). Indeed, the scale had changed.

Director: Sudhir Mishra

Cast: Rahul Bhat, Richa Chadda, Aditi Rao Hydari, Saurabh Shukla, Vineet Kumar Singh, Dalip Tahil, Vipin Sharma, Deepraj Rana, Sohaila Kapur, Anurag Kashyap

Daas Dev, a film Sudhir Mishra has directed and co-written (screenplay and dialogue), reimagines the story of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s Devdas with some Hamletian angst that doesn’t sit easy with it.

It is set in the Hindi cow belt, complete with its cynical, malevolent, capricious politics built around land, farmers, caste, familial fidelity and treachery.

Its writing is interesting, casting inspired, and Aditi Rao Hydari has a meaty, exciting role that she gently digs her manicured nails into and then makes it her own.

Problem is that while Mishra always piques interest — primarily because two of his films, Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin and Hazaroon Khwaishein Aisi, are still very special — these days he also disappoints. And Daas Dev is no exception. It’s a film that is made and gets unmade by small things.

Daas Dev is a film that’s in two minds. While Mishra wants Daas Dev to have the punch that Tigmanshu Dhulia and Anurag Kashyap’s very masculine, dehat films have, he neither has the skill nor the commitment to see big dramatic scenes or characters through.

Though he picks scenes with dramatic potential, scenes that are the staple of commercial, mainstream films as the main plot points — an intense carnal encounter, or a crazy shooting with an insane body count, for example — he loses interest all too soon, and his film saunters away from the crime scene, literally, with a hunchbacked reminder to self to stay true to realistic, artsy cinema.

Mishra’s Daas Dev tries to impersonates commercial cinema for dramatic power, but then has an anxiety attack about being too melodramatic. And so, with some self-loathing, disowns his own doing.

Kashyap makes a special appearance in Daas Dev. He should have stayed on a bit longer, if only to muzzle Mishra during dramatic scenes, releasing his mouth to say ’’cut’’ only when it was actually time to shout “cut!’’

Daas Dev opens in Uttar Pradesh in 1997 where, in a place called Jahana, Vishambar Pratap (Anurag Kashyap), a charismatic, young politician, is delivering a rousing speech to farmers about their rights, and throwing promises to protect their land. His younger brother Avdesh Pratap is sitting behind him, having been anointed the political heir apparent in bade bhaiyya’s Janata Kalyan Party.

Vishambar’s little son Dev and his bestie Paro are also quickly introduced to establish the following: He’s wayward, she’s mildly sententious, and they are forever entwined.

All this while a husky voiceover has been saying seemingly insightful but awfully pretentious things about power, ishq and the Devs (lords) of the world having little daases (servants) inside them.

All too soon tragedy strikes, and the film takes a 20-year jump. The setting and the game remain the same, as do the main players. Only the young one, now all grown up, join them.

Daas Dev is more interested in telling us the story of power, than the story of ishq.

It spends a lot of time showing us how men and women cultivate, groom and maintain power for the heady joy of flexing it. And when power games are played in the political arena, then voters, money from corporates, friendships and rivalries are nothing more than necessary tools to grab and retain power.

Inside this sits the story of Dev babu, Paro and Chandramukhi with some nice, some strange twists.

The film follows the trajectory of the original, more or less.

Dev (Rahul Bhat), a spoilt rich man, is an alcoholic, a drug addict in love with Paro (Richa Chadda).

“Socialist politician ki non-socialist aulad’’, the voiceover informs us as Dev is being taken at gunpoint by one Chadha he owes money to.

Because his Chacha Avdesh (Saurabh Shukla) has had a stroke, this incident brings to the fore SK, short for Srikant (Dalip Tahil), a wheeler-dealer, and Chandni (Aditi Rao Hydari), his sizzling-hot all-purpose fixer.

“I’m the Chandramukhi of this story,” Chandni says.

It’s her voice that’s been instructing us about how the game of power and love must be played.",entertainment,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/280418/daas-dev-movie-review-this-devdas-belongs-to-chandramukhi.html

Director: Sudhir Mishra; Cast: Richa Chadda, Aditi Rao Hydari, Rahul Bhat, Saurabh Shukla

Sudhir Mishra’s latest film has a title that wants to scream at you its creativity — or lack thereof — but ends up with an indiscernible, squeaked out nonsense. Mishra begins with three notes, one to the author of Devdas, Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, another to Shakespeare, and the third to his grandfather, Dwarka Prasad Mishra. They together make up some balderdash one liners about love, power and politics.

But if this film was serious enough for Mishra to begin with personal notes, why is there an absence of heart? There isn’t even a semblance of staging. Why is absolutely no one in the film interested? Daas Dev is a level of shoddy that I did not know, of all people, Sudhir Mishra was capable of. The very idea of iterating over Devdas in 2018 sounds like a paper that must be flung into, not the recycle bin, but some permanent resting place.

Das is Dev (Rahul Bhat) and Paro is Paro (Richa Chadda). The makers don’t even want to disturb the Wikipedia editors enough to find out the names of the principal characters in this version. Chandramukhi, though, is Chandni (Aditi Rao Hydari), the narrator of this story. That this straight-shooting film needed a constant voice-over is puzzling. Chandni the narrator is self-aware. She quips about us, the audience, recognising that she is the Chandramukhi of this story.

Apparently, the makers are clued in on our weariness about Devdas. She even yells during a moment, asking for a song to be switched off and the song in the background abruptly stops. She admits she hates that song. We see a ray of hope. Maybe at some point she’ll have similar thoughts as us about this film and request that it all be wrapped up. No luck. This Devdas train trudges on. With its disinterested direction, devoid of nuance in its treatment of politics, power, love. At one point, Dev, excited by his new political prospects, walks into tense territory against advice, without appropriate security. We hear gunshots and see ten to twenty villagers fleeing. We don’t know from what. When we arrive at the scene, it looks like some villagers had just finished having heavy lunch and were all about to partake in a nice, long siesta.

Aditi Rao Hydari is here doing what she does best — look ethereal and flawless in terrible films. Richa Chadda is here doing what she does best — impart some dignity to the proceedings where nothing is going right. Rahul Bhat, I don’t know what he does best. If it is looking like a Fawad Khan knockoff, then he’s got it all taken care of. As for Sudhir Mishra? We know what he does best. He’ll be better remembered.

Richa Chadha, Rahul Bhat, Aditi Rao Hydari, Saurabh Shukla, Anurag Kashyap, Dalip TahilSudhir Mishra4 Stars (out of 5)Dedicated at once to Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, William Shakespeare and freedom fighter-politician Dwarka Prasad Mishra (the director's own grandfather), Sudhir Mishra's first film since 2013's Inkaar is an audacious, dizzying, pulsating drama that merges two literary classics,and, and transports them to a place light years away from their respective cores.The doomed love story ofgets a vigorous contemporary spin - it isn't quite as downbeat as the much-filmed original - and the tragic revenge saga of Hamlet winds up in a shadowy political household where intrigue and conspiracy lurk in every shady nook.The writer-director locates his intriguing synthesis in the explosive epicenter of a regional power struggle in a fictional Uttar Pradesh town where the law is at the mercy of the very people who are charged with enforcing its rule. The jaunty, sweeping, rough-hewn storytelling style - he favours high-pitched expression over subtle enunciation, especially in the dramatic flashpoints - mirrors the fraught, unsteady nature of the world he depicts.Mishra has a bunch of tremendously malleable actors to interpret his vision. They go all out to live their parts. Good as the three principal actors - Rahul Bhat, Richa Chadha and Aditi Rao Hydari - are, it is the supporting cast of Saurabh Shukla, Vipin Sharma, Sohaila Kapur, Ekavali Khanna, Anil George, Deepraj Rana and Vineet Kumar Singh that propels the drama forward.They play a bunch of excitable, loud and irrepressible characters in a story of love, lies, greed and skullduggery that hinges on grand dramatic flourishes. The film seeks to draw attention to many politically inflected issues of the day - land rights, farmers' unrest, indiscriminate bauxite mining and political adventurism bred by a sense of impunity - but does not get bogged down by its bleeding-heart impulses.hits the ground running and plunges headlong into the heart of the action. It reveals its key dramatis personae in a blinding rush. The early breakneck speed may be disorienting for some, but it is absolutely in order. It encapsulates the chaos and cacophony of a setting that is infested by power-crazed men jousting with all their might to protect their turfs and wily women blessed with strong survival instincts.It isn't solely by separatingandin the title and changing the established sequence that Mishra flips the gender balance around. The women inare no pushovers. They are strong-willed, assertive individuals who can stare down anybody who looks them in the eye in the misplaced hope of browbeating them into submission.And it isn't just the present-day Paro and Chandramukhi who don a steely cloak. In one startling scene, a political muscleman who has fallen foul of the male protagonist uses the women in his home - his three wives and 15 daughters - as a protective shield. The women give absolutely nothing away and Dev eventually has to beat a hasty retreat.At another crucial plot point, the one woman in the story who seems trapped in silent oblivion - Paro's reticent mother Malti (Ekavali Khanna) - finds her voice and asserts her presence. She is a bolt from the blue, a shriek of defiance, a reminder that no woman in this seemingly patriarchal set-up is to be taken lightly.The songs that Mishra employs to further the film's thematic philosophy - they are composed around the poetry of Bulle Shah, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Munir Niazi and Swanand Kirkire, who is in illustrious company but not a whit out of place with his anthem-like Azaad kar number that he himself has sung - provide a firm spine to the background score.The editing by Archit Rastogi is true to the spirit of the tale, lending the narrative its pace and dynamism while director of photography Sachin K. Krishn's controlled lighting and evocative play with shadows and silhouettes create the right visual angularities for this twisted tale of relentless trickery.The male protagonist, Dev Pratap Chauhan (Rahul Bhat), the scion of a political family that has seen better days, is a drunken wreck, a complete misfit in this jungle. But circumstances suck him into the vortex of overarching ambition and unbridled passion. His mind addled with drugs and drinks, Dev is driven by the imposed need to carry his father's legacy forward and his wavering emotions for his childhood love, a feisty Paro Singh (Chadha) , and the willowy femme fatale Chandni Mehra (Hydari)., about individuals grappling to take control of their fates, is a tale told by a woman - Chandni, a present-day incarnation of Chandramukhi, who banks upon her seductive guiles to manipulate the men around her who feel that they wield power over her but are in reality mere putty in her hands. Dev is no exception.The film opens in Jahana, Uttar Pradesh, in 1997. A chopper carrying a popular activist-politician Vishambhar Pratap Chauhan (Anurag Kashyap) explodes in mid-air as soon as it lifts off from a rally ground. Just before the incident, we have seen the man deliver a fiery speech exhorting farmers to fight for their rights. The regional satrap's brother Avdhesh takes over the reins of the party.Twenty years later. Delhi. The late Vishambhar Pratap's son, Dev, is waylaid by goons led by a businessman he owes a large sum of money to. He has a gun pointed at his head. ""You don't kill a horse you've put your money on,"" Dev wisecracks. He is taken captive. The encounter ends in a bloodbath unleashed by another moneybag, Shrikant Sahay (Dalip Tahil). Chandni, Shrikant's mistress, keeps a close eye on the goings-on.As the action shifts back to Jahana, the onus is now on Dev to work his way around a maze of intrigue and dangerous ploys aimed at reviving his father's hold over the region. Involved actively in the game are his uncle Avdhesh (Saurabh Shukla), his widowed mother Sushila Devi (Sohaila Kapur), the family's loyal retainer Naval Singh (Anil George), opposition politician Ramashray Shukla (Vipin Sharma), his nephew Milan Shukla (Vineet Kumar Singh) and a rough and ready hatchet man Prabhunath Singh (Deepraj Rana). Dev's followers begin to see shades of his father in him, but he is barely willing to lead the flock. His engagement with the power games that he is thrust into is tentative at best. He isn't comfortable at all being a slave to his legacy. He opts to focus instead on his relationship with Paro. But the rules that obtain here are beyond his control and he will have to exert himself to break free.must rank among the better screen adaptations of, not the least because of its daring, free-wheeling departures from the norm laid down for cinema derived from literary sources.",entertainment,https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/daas-dev-movie-review-richa-chadha-aditi-rao-hydari-rahut-bhat-film-gives-devdas-a-vigorous-contempo-1843623

"Amy Schumer is happily married and basking in the release of her latest film I Feel Pretty, but the actress has revealed she had to overcome a lot to get to this happy point.

The comedian, 36, told Oprah Winfrey that the abuse she suffered during a past left her “convinced” that she “wasn’t lovable.”

“I got hurt by accident a lot. He didn’t realize how hard he’d grabbed me or shook me or pushed me, and I would fall and hit something then I’d be hurt,” Schumer explained to the host as part of OWN’s SuperSoul Conversations. “I can picture being thrown on the hood of a car like it was an hour ago.”

“And running from him, carrying my shoes and running from him, running into backyards trying to get away from him because I was afraid for my life,” she continued. “It’s so out of body. You think, ‘I’m not this woman, who is this woman? This can’t be me.’ I’m not that kind of woman, and then you realize there is no kind of woman. It happens to all woman.”

The Snatched actress added that she had been “convinced” by her ex that she “wasn’t lovable and he was the only person who could ever possibly love me.”

“And then again I would feel bad for him after he hurt me about how bad he would feel,” she said. “You don’t choose to fall in love with someone who hurts you, and you can be in love with someone who hurts you.”

Schumer also opened up to Winfrey, 64, about losing her virginity while she was sleeping when she was younger, saying the experience affected her so deeply she brought it up in her stand-up routines.

“I lost my virginity while I was asleep,” she revealed. “So, in my stand-up, I used to talk about — I called it, ‘gray-area rape,’ which was my way of bringing this up in my stand-up… trying to make people laugh while they learned. When we hear about rape when we’re children, it’s about a guy popping out from a bush and this villain. They don’t say it’s probably going to be a guy who you know very well. It could be your husband, your friend. You think when that happens to you, you say, ‘Okay, well this isn’t someone I want to see rotting in a jail cell but what he did to me was wrong and I didn’t consent.'”

“In my stand-up, I would say if she’s asleep that’s a no,” she said, adding her boyfriend at the time had explained that he had thought she “knew” they were going to have sex.

“I didn’t say anything [about consenting]. He was my boyfriend, I loved him, I had to comfort him,” Schumer recalled. “I also felt really angry which… it was just a feeling I had, I felt really angry with him. It’s a rage that’s stayed with me. I don’t think you lose that. As women, we’re trained not to get angry because that makes people dismiss you right away. But I felt — I wanted to comfort him and try to push my anger down.”

Winfrey asked Schumer if she still defined her first sexual experience as a rape, to which the comedian said, “I, personally, feel like I lost my virginity through rape.”

“I didn’t consent, we hadn’t discussed it [having sex],” she continued. “We weren’t there in our relationship, we weren’t at that moment.”

In her 2016 book, The Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo, Schumer wrote about the experience saying her boyfriend at the time didn’t ask her or look her in the eyes to confirm she was awake before having sex with her.

“I was confused as to why he would have done this to me in this way, but the most dominant feeling I felt was that the guy I was in love with was upset and I wanted to help him,” she wrote. “I was seventeen years old and wanted my boyfriend to like me.”

"Actor and stand-up comic Amy Schumer has revealed that she was raped by a former boyfriend, someone she ""really trusted"", when she was young.

The 36-year-old actor opened up about the experience to media mogul Oprah Winfrey and said her comic skits often reflected her life story where she would say if a woman is asleep, one cannot asssume to have the consent to engage in a sexual act with her.

""When we hear about rape when we're children, and we're being warned about it, it's about a guy popping out from a bush... and some villain. They don't say it's probably gonna be a guy you know really well. It could be your husband. It could be your friend. And so you think, when that happens you, you say, 'OK, this isn't someone I want to see rotting in a jail cell, but what he did to me was wrong, and I didn't consent.'

""And for me, I lost my virginity while I was asleep. And that's not OK. So, in my stand-up I would say, 'If she's asleep, that's a no.' Just hoping that a couple guys would see that and it would be met in that moment, like, 'This is a no. I heard that somewhere',"" Schumer said, according to Jezebel.

The ""I Feel Pretty"" actor said when she confronted her then boyfriend about her sexual assault, ""The first thing he said was, 'I thought you knew.' I didn't say anything yet, and he says, 'I thought you knew.'""

To this Winfrey said, ""What's interesting about that is that you then were feeling bad for how he would feel the next day.""

The actor said she loved him and it was her training as a woman that she did not want to ""get angry"" as it pushed people away.

""There's sort of no place for that anger. But I felt I wanted to comfort him because he felt so bad and he was so worried. And I just tried to push my anger down,"" she added.

Schumer said she and her boyfriend eventually started having consensual sex, but pointed out that it does not negate the initial assault.

When Winfrey asked her how she would sum up the incident in retrospect, the actor paused and replied, ""I personally feel like I lost my virginity through rape. I didn't consent. We hadn't discussed it. We weren't there in our relationship. We weren't at that moment. And we talked about things.",entertainment,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/hollywood/280418/amy-schumer-interview.html
"Hollywood actor Amy Schumer has revealed that she lost her virginity through a date rape by her then boyfriend. The Trainwreck star lost her virginity at the age of 17. She had first mentioned it in her 2016 memoir, The Girl With The Lower Back Tattoo, that the sex was non-consensual, explaining that her unnamed boyfriend penetrated her while she was asleep, reports aceshowbiz.com.

“You think when that happens you say, ‘Okay, well, this isn’t someone I want to see rotting in a jail cell, but what he did to me was wrong’,” Schumer told US media mogul Oprah Winfrey in an episode of SuperSoul Conversations.

“I didn’t consent, and for me, I lost my virginity while I was asleep - and that’s not okay.”

Schumer said her former-boyfriend felt bad after the incident and she was angry about it, but she still tried to comfort him.

“The first thing he said was, ‘I thought you knew. I didn’t say anything yet... He was my boyfriend. I loved him. I had to comfort him.”

“I also felt really angry,” she added.

“It was just a feeling I had. I felt really angry at him, and it’s a rage that has stayed with me. I don’t think you lose that.

The actor eventually had consensual sex with her former boyfriend, but she wasn’t able to get over the deep betrayal she felt over the alleged sexual assault. “I feel like I lost my virginity through rape,” she said.

She added: “I didn’t consent, we hadn’t discussed it, we weren’t there in our relationship, we weren’t at that moment and we talked about things, we were open with each other.”",entertainment,https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/i-lost-my-virginity-to-rape-says-actor-amy-schumer/story-6oPaGaRx0okE4RxnF08ieM.html

"Image caption Abba won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974, and went on to sell hundreds of millions of records

It's hard to imagine now but, once upon a time, people hated Abba.

Those spangly satin jumpsuits, their Eurovision origins, the wedding disco ubiquity of Dancing Queen - they all conspired to consign Abba to the cheesy-smelling scrapheap of pop.

The band were frequently misunderstood as kitsch because they wrote soft, optimistic pop songs. And, to be fair, some of their lyrics were pretty banal. (Nina, Pretty Ballerina, a weak tea version of Dancing Queen, is particularly awful.)

But a critical reappraisal began in the 1990s, with the release of the bewilderingly-successful Abba Gold compilation (30 million units and counting) and the emergence of tribute acts like Bjorn Again.

Some people embraced Abba ironically. But those people were wrong.

Abba are one of the most straightforwardly brilliant pop bands of all time.

SOS? Amazing. Mamma Mia? Amazing. So Long? Amazing. The Name Of The Game? Amazing. Chiquitita? You get the picture.

Image caption The band haven't recorded together since 1982

Anyone with a passing acquaintance with melody loves what Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn and Anni-Frid achieved.

""Purely from a songwriting point of view they were up there with the best,"" said Noel Gallagher in 2004.

""They enter Eurovision singing about the battle of Waterloo in platforms [and] they were all shagging each other? Does it get better than that?""

Last year, Michael Eavis pledged he would un-cancel Glastonbury if Abba reformed, while artists including Portishead, Kylie, Sinead O'Connor and The Carpenters have covered their music.

The group never officially split up, drifting into the dusk in 1983 after recording sessions for a planned ninth album didn't work out.

Since then, they've resisted the temptation to reform, through thick, thin and offers of $1bn in cash.

Until Friday, that is, when the band announced they'd gone back into the studio and cut two new songs.

""I'm half-thrilled and half-terrified,"" says Kitty Empire, pop critic for The Observer.

""No matter what they produce, can it ever live up to this weight of expectation? But I'm cautiously optimistic.""

And herein lies the problem. Can any band reform 35 years after their peak and recapture what fans loved about them?

""I think a good parallel is when the surviving Beatles got back together to do Free As A Bird [in 1995],"" says music writer Pete Paphides.

""Some people were sniffy about it at the beginning, when they first heard it, and I was one of them.

""I was in my early 20s and had that 20-something arrogance that you sometimes have. But, actually, I can barely get to the end of Free As A Bird now without my eyes watering.

""I think it's just a beautiful song and I've lived with it over the years. My youngest daughter plays it on the piano. And that feels as valid and important a part of their legacy as any other Beatles songs.""

The Beatles aren't the only ones who got it right, says Paphides, listing Blur, New Order and Take That as bands who bounced back from a break-up.

""The Take That album was really clever because they weren't trying to be the band that they were before,"" he says. ""It was like they'd stepped back and asked themselves, 'Who are we as people, and how can we credibly do this?'

""It was an album that honoured the fact that both their fans and they as people were older. So there was a bittersweet aspect to that record, which I think sort of touched people.""

EDM banger?

So what will Abba 2.0 sound like? Perhaps we can gather clues from the quartet's recent solo material.

Agnetha Faltskog made an accomplished return to the studio with 2013's A, which included the single When You Really Loved Someone.

Her sole writing credit, I Keep Them On The Floor Beside My Bed, found the singer scattering photos of an old lover across her bedroom floor, wondering what happened to their relationship.

A pleading, age-appropriate ballad, it feels connected to the wistful melancholy of Abba's swansong The Visitors - an obvious jumping-off point for new material.

Benny Andersson's recent album of solo piano pieces, released on classical label Deutsche Grammophon, reinforced his profound gift for melody. However it seems unlikely to inform the Abba reunion.

A better indicator is the Benny Andersson Orchestra (BAO), which combines his passion for pop, rock and the oompah rhythms of Swedish folk with surprisingly intoxicating effects.

The band's 2009 single Du Ar Min Man (You Are My Man) - which spent four years in the Swedish chart - wouldn't sound out of place on one of the earlier Abba albums.

Anni-Frid Lyngstad, meanwhile, has largely avoided the recording studio since the '80s.

However, her 2010 cover of Morning Has Broken, recorded with Swedish musician Georg Wadenius, shows how effective her voice would be over the sort of stripped-back acoustic arrangements Benny and Bjorn favoured in their 1990s musical Kristina.

Thankfully, then, no-one seems inclined to give Abba an EDM makeover.

The one song title they've revealed so far - I Still Have Faith In You - suggests a timeworn romance perfectly suited to Agnetha and Frida's strong-but-vulnerable vocals.

Can we safely assume the crisis has been averted, then?

""I think their filter is very good,"" says Kitty Empire. ""I think their quality control will be impeccable.

""But my personal fear is that it will be the cheesy end of Abba rather than the kind of Abba songs that very gently twist a knife into your innards and make you cry.""

Rod Stephen, founder member of Bjorn Again, agrees.

""Yes, there is a risk to their legacy being undone [but] I know Benny and Bjorn wouldn't release something in this way unless they were good songs.

""Even if they do misfire, I don't think anybody would blame them for trying.""

For his cover-bandmate Agnetha (she doesn't like using her real name), the chance to put new songs in the set list comes as something of a relief.

""After doing Abba for 20 years every weekend, it would actually be quite nice to learn new material!"" she laughs.

But for Paphides, the arrival of new music is less compelling than the story of how it came about.

""I'm happy for them,"" he says. ""I'm happy they felt so relaxed in each other's company, that it didn't seem like an onerous thing for them to even countenance the idea of making music together.

""It's a lovely thing - not just in terms of the creative merit, but because making music with people you love is a joyful thing.

""And they don't owe us anything, they've given us more wonderful music than we could've reasonably asked for, and it's sustained us over the decades.

""And in a weird way I don't care if it turns out not to be as good as some of my favourite Abba moments, because they've given us way more than we could've asked them for.""

Abba-solutely.

"For years, many of us have had a dream, a fantasy, to help us through reality. It was that one day the tectonic plates of pop would shift and the greatest group of all time would pull on their white platform boots and once more dazzle the world with their genius.

In our dream, Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn and Anni-Frid would put aside their differences, their divorces, their satin plus-fours and their regrettable devotion to appliqued cats and get back together as Abba, to thrill us all over again.

‘No, no, no, no,’ they said. ‘It will never, never, never, never happen.’

One of them even told me to my face. When I met Bjorn Ulvaeus in Stockholm for the opening of the Abba museum in 2013, he was at pains to point out, as he always does, that there was no truth in any rumours that the group would one day get back together.

Glory days: Benny Andersson, Agnetha Faltskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Bjorn Ulvaeus during the opening night of Abba's first North American tour in Edmonton, Canada in 1979

As good as the real thing? Abba plan to use new technology and tour using holograms. Pictured is a man singing karaoke with an Abba hologram

‘I promise you, Abba will never reform – I couldn’t bear the stress of disappointing everyone,’ he said.

Well, so much for his promises.

They have recorded two new songs to be premiered on a tour using virtual reality technology to bring them back to life onstage in all their poptastic 1970s glory. That chimes with another reason Ulvaeus has always been so reluctant for the group to reform.

‘When you listen to our music, isn’t there something good in having the image of four young, energetic people? Better than four geriatrics, that is for sure,’ he told me.

Back together: The group appeared together after years of feuding at 'Mamma Mia! The Party' musical premier in Stockholm, Sweden in 2016

But clearly not as good as having those geriatrics ‘de-aged’ to look just as they did in 1979.

One of the songs, I Still Have Faith In You, will be performed by the digital Abba in a BBC special to be broadcast in December.

Confused? Me, too.

So the new songs are real, but the Abba we will see performing them are not?

As much as I love Abba, I can’t imagine that a concert featuring mere holograms of my heroes could compete with the real thing. No matter how technically ground-breaking and pioneering the techniques might be, would it be an entirely uplifting experience?

The history book on the shelf: Abba after winning the Swedish branch of the Eurovision Song Contest with their song Waterloo

Surely the whole point of a live show is being in the moment, sharing the same atmosphere and air as the act you have come to see?

And I confess I might find it rather melancholy. To see how they had not aged over the past four decades would only emphasise how much I have, too.

However, Abba are full of surprises. You never know what they are going to not do next. They did not appear in the global sensation stage show Mamma Mia!, nor the film version starring Meryl Streep, nor the sequel that has just been made.

Perhaps the truth is that they made music that will never die and they are so fabulous they don’t have to do actually do anything, they just have to be.

And if that means being a singing avatar rather than a singing star, then so be it.",entertainment,http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5666945/JAN-MOIR-fears-Abba-reunion-melancholic.html

To the delight of millions of fans across the globe, ABBA have recorded new music together for the first time in 35 years.

The band has described the shock move as an “unexpected” but “extremely joyful experience”.

The former couples say it seems like “time had stood still” and their last studio sessions feels like it ­happened just “a short holiday” ago.

The Swedish pop superstars, who split in 1983, will debut new single I Still Have Faith In You in a two-hour BBC TV special in December.

But before die-hard fans unearth the sequins and spandex, note that the notoriously brittle quartet has ruled out any reunion gigs.

However, holograms of the band, dubbed “ABBA-tars”, will go on tour next year. The concept has already proved popular, with a Roy Orbison hologram playing concerts earlier this year.

In a statement yesterday, ABBA confirmed: “The decision to go ahead with the exciting ABBA avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence.

“We all four felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio.

“So we did. And it was like time had stood still and that we only had been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience,” the group added.

“We may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good.”

In 2000, ABBA reportedly rejected offer of over £725million to tour again.

(Image: REUTERS)

Instead, the band have now opted to be scanned and photographed from all angles to produce human-like holograms that will perform on their behalf.

ABBA’s spokeswoman Gorel Hanser has described the new music as “familiar but also modern”. She said: “It was like old times. Easy as nothing – it didn’t feel weird that they hadn’t been in the studio together for 35 years.”

ABBA formed in 1971, when songwriters Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus, began dating singers Anni–Frid [Frida] Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog.

The group’s name is an acronym of the initials of all four members’ first names.

Just three years later, they were two married couples – Benny with Frida, and Bjorn wed to ­Agnetha – with four children bet­ween them.

When they stepped on to the Eurovision Song Contest stage at the Brighton Dome in 1974 – wearing silk shirts and knickerbockers – they were widely dismissed as a one-hit wonder.

Their winning entry, Waterloo, became a No.1 single. And a string of pop smash hits followed, including Mamma Mia, Fernando and Dancing Queen. Nine No.1 singles cemented the group’s place as one of pop’s biggest success stories.

During their nine-year tenure, they sold more than 400 million singles and albums, and still shift millions each year. ABBA Gold is the second-biggest selling album in the UK to date, with 30 million sales – just behind Queen’s Greatest Hits.

Yet Bjorn, now 72, believes the group were “despised” by critics and branded “unfashionable”. However Frida believes their Swedish outlook helped them cope with their lack of credibility.

(Image: Getty Images Europe)

She said: “We have a very down-to-earth way of looking at ourselves and what we do. We’ve never had any hubris.”

Bjorn and Agnetha’s marriage ended in 1979 but the group continued touring.

And it is that year that the band have selected for their Abbatars to return to in the upcoming tour. Bjorn explains: “We thought we looked good that year.”

Incredibly, Agnetha, 68, insists she had no issue with Bjorn bringing his new girlfriend, Swedish journalist Lena Kallersjo, on their US tour the year they divorced. But Agnetha, who suffered from stage fright and anxiety, was said to have hated being apart from her children, Linda and Christian, and vowed never to tour again after 1980.

Bjorn married Lena in 1981 and the couple are still together today.

Within two years, Benny and Frida had also split. One of the band’s most famous hits, Knowing Me, Knowing You – reportedly known within the group as their “divorce song” – is about the couples’ splits.

(Image: AFP)

And Bjorn has said he found writing another divorce-inspired hit, The Winner Takes It All, as “a kind of therapy”.

Agnetha, who fell in love with Bjorn when she was just 19, reportedly did have therapy following their split.

Saying she felt “mangled” by the experience, she later dated psychiatrist Hakan Lonnback – who reportedly tried to save their marriage – as well as a ­detective hired after she was subjected to kidnap threats.

In 1990, reclusive Agnetha married surgeon Tomas Sonnenfeld in secrecy.

The marriage ended around the time the singer’s mother died after throwing herself from their sixth-floor flat. Her father died the following year.

Then, in 1997, Agnetha started a relationship with her stalker – Dutch forklift driver Gert van der Graaf.

She had complained to police about him but has admitted: “It was a very intense attention from him and after a while I felt I could not resist any more. I wanted to know him.”

(Image: Getty)

They split in 2000 and she later took out a restraining order against him.

Other ABBA tracks, including When All is Said and Done, reference Frida and Benny’s split. Frida has said: “There was a lot of emotion behind it and it was not always easy to continue recording.”

Benny, 71, remarried and divorced again and has been teetotal since 2011 after years of boozing.

Frida, 72, became a princess after marrying German Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss von Plauen, who died of lymphoma in 1999. She is now dating Henry Smith, the 5th Viscount Hambleden.

The band’s final album was 1981’s The Visitors. A year later, they made their final recordings together, for the compilation album The Singles.

Bjorn said in 2015: “We took a break in ’82. It’s still a break and will remain so. You’ll never see us on stage again.”

Despite all four attending the 2008 Mamma Mia! film premiere, they declined to pose together. Agnetha failed to join her former bandmates for the opening of Stockholm’s ABBA museum in 2013.

(Image: WENN.com)

In 2016, they appeared on stage together for the first time in 34 years, at a restaurant launch in Sweden.

Last week, Bjorn said: “On the whole, we toured very little. We had, like, 10 years together and maybe we toured, like, seven months. So to go on tour as a geriatric... I don’t know.”

Yesterday’s announcement sparked huge excitement at a possible reunion, but Ms Hanser cautioned: “No, you cannot expect them to join forces on stage again. They will not do that.”

Since disbanding, the group still rakes in a fortune.

The film adaptation of Mamma Mia! has made £476million to date. A sequel – Here We Go Again! – will be released in July. Royalties and rights for the stage show and film net Bjorn and Benny £2million each a year.

Last year, Bjorn reiterated the group’s reluctance to perform, saying they don’t need the money.

“It would be such hassle, it would be enormous,” he explained. “It would be like robbing yourself of perhaps two or three years out of your life, when I could be paddling on my surf ski.”

And, with their “ABBA-tars” alone expected to generate “hundreds of millions of pounds” for the one-time supergroup, it looks like Bjorn won’t be in deep water any time soon.",entertainment,https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/abba-send-fans-wild-recording-12441311

DD find success with clever plans and perfect execution

• Last updated on Sat, 28 Apr, 2018, 09:16 AM Vishaal Loganathan in Delhi

Avesh, Boult, Plunkett and spinners executed their plans well as DD found success mantra to win their second game of IPL 2018 © BCCI

Delhi Daredevils finally arrested their run of defeats with an impressive 55-run victory over Kolkara Knight Riders at the Feroz Shah Stadium. The game, in some ways, signalled the end of the Gautam Gambhir era. The left-hander had not only relinquished captaincy after the last game, but was also dropped in Shreyas Iyer's first game as captain of Delhi Daredevils. The young leader displayed great skill with the bat and equal shrewdness when on the field to drive his side to a long-awaited and desperately-needed victory.

The victory may have come with Iyer's blistering knock of 93 from just 40 balls, and Prithvi Shaw's maiden IPL fifty as its foundation, but it was DD's' plans with the ball that helped them defend their massive total. KKR, with a slew of big hitters in their side, had the arsenal to chase down the score, but the home team's clever plans outdid them. In particular, it was the home side's' superlative performance in the powerplay that helped them stop KKR in their tracks. It even allowed them a buffer, with them able to romp home to a big victory despite Andre Russell's blitzy knock towards the end.

It was not just that DD had plans and all of them worked. Their bowlers were good enough to adapt and mix things up as needed, and that was paramount in overcoming the KKR challenge.

On a pitch that was a tad two-paced, DD quickly figured out that the bouncer would be a tough ball to play. When the hosts were batting, KKR welcomed them with a spin test in the powerplay. Colin Munro and Shaw were able to line up the spinners and get their side off to a strong start. In contrast, the home team relied on pace. Glenn Maxwell was asked to bowl the second over, and after he'd had the desired impact by getting rid of Chris Lynn, DD went for pace. Boult had both Robin Uthappa and Sunil Narine out with short balls to set up things early for the home side. Avesh Khan added his name to list of wicket-takers by getting rid of Nitish Rana with another short ball as DD took higher ground in the battle.

DD didn't look like they had come out with a short ball ploy. However, once Boult struck to send back Uthappa, their bowlers quickly realised the short ball would be a wicket-taking option. Liam Plunkett and Avesh started to bang the ball time and again to keep the KKR batsmen on their toes.

For KKR, it was only Mitchell Johnson who constantly used the short ball option, but all of DD's pacers used it liberally. The result? By the end of the powerplay, KKR were 51 for four, with three wickets having fallen to the short ball, while the hosts had raked up 57 for no loss.

Compare this with KKR's bowling powerplay. As has been the trend this IPL for them, they went with what works best for them - spin. They had long on and mid wicket back for both Shaw and Munro, and tempted the duo to hit the spinners with the turn. Both Kuldeep Yadav and Piyush Chawla used the conventional delivery or the wrong 'un depending on the batsman, and the lack of variation finally cost them. When the pacers, Shivam Mavi and Johnson, were introduced soon after, they sprayed the ball around. There was only one short ball, from Johnson, during the powerplay.

KKR's inability to do well in the powerplay was lamented by their captain Dinesh Karthik, who felt the team looked like it had just turned up and not wanted to win the contest.

""It was very hard (to proceed with plans after not picking wickets in the powerplay). We needed wickets in the powerplay and that's what they got. It really helped them. If you don't get wickets in the powerplay, then they're always going hard and you're wishing for a wicket somewhere. It clearly didn't happen. That helped them go at a similar momentum throughout the game.""

For DD, once the powerplay went their way, it was just a case of hanging on to that momentum. Shaw ensured that they did, with a fine fifty, and Iyer applied an emphatic finish with some stunning strokeplay.

But they had already impressed with the ball in the last game. They just needed to do the right stuff again. As it so happened, the pitch played right into DD's hands.

""We know that our strength is pace currently. The way they are bowling in the powerplay and outside it is really amazing. Obviously Plunkett coming into the side, the way he's bowled in the last two games has been outstanding. Even Boult, he's leading as an example for all the bowlers in the team. Usually we decide to go with Mishra in the powerplay, but since Narine was there, we thought of getting Maxwell and fortunately we got the wicket of Lynn,"" Iyer said after the match.

The difference in the powerplays eventually resulted in DD stealing a march on KKR, and ending up on the winning side by 55 runs. With their campaign back on track, they will hope that the game against KKR was only the start of a trend.

"In his first IPL game as captain, Shreyas Iyer took a big gamble by dropping Delhi's famous son and his former skipper Gautam Gambhir on Friday. However, the Mumbai boy soon compensated it by smashing an unbeaten 40-ball 93 as the Delhi Daredevils beat the Kolkata Knight Riders by XX wickets here at the Ferozeshah Kotla.

The captain's knock by Iyer ensured that the hosts posted a daunting 219/4 against the hapless KKR bowling attack.

Chasing the mammoth target, KKR had to deal with four early jolts as opener Chris Lynn was cleaned up by Glenn Maxwell in just the second over the case.

Robin Uthappa, the in-form Sunil Narine and Nitish Rana were also sent back to the pavilion early as the visitors were reduced to 46/4 in 5.1 overs.

And when skipper Dinesh Karthik too departed at the team's score of 77, it was always going to be an improbable task for Karthik and his boys.

And despite Andre Russell and young Shubman Gill stitching together a 64-run partnership to raise minor hopes of a miraculous victory for the Knights, two wickets in the 16th over by Amit Mishra evaporated all those hopes.

In the end, KKR could only manage 164/9 as the hosts won the game by 55 runs.

The day also witnessed another India U-19 star Prithvi Shaw showing his class in the senior circuit with a fine half-century (62 off 44 balls) in only his second IPL outing. The Iyer-Shaw duo was so ruthless during its stay in the middle that it accumulated 70 runs off just seven overs after the fall of Colin Munro's (33 off 18 balls) wicket.

Shaw's fifty meant that he joined Sanju Samson in becoming the youngest batsman to score a half-century in the IPL at an age of 18 years and 169 days, with Samson reaching the milestone in 2013.

While Shaw struck seven fours and two sixes during his stay at the crease, his captain slammed three fours and 10 maximums during a knock that left the home crowd more entertained.

Iyer especially turned the heat on in the final overs, and in the company of Glenn Maxwell, ensured that his team went past the 200-run mark with authority.

The visiting KKR bowlers failed to contain the flow of runs and Piyush Chawla (1/33) was the only one to have conceded less than nine runs an over from the bowling pack of six.

Earlier, KKR won the toss and invited the bottom-placed hosts to bat first on a slightly greenish Kotla track. All-rounder Vijay Shankar and opener Colin Munro were brought back into the playing XI by Iyer at the expense of Gambhir and Dan Christian. KKR, on the other hand, made only one change, bringing in Mitchell Johnson for Tom Curran.",sport,http://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/report-ipl-2018-captain-shreyas-iyer-stands-up-as-delhi-daredevils-down-kolkata-knight-riders-2609430
"Cricket captains who happen to be Indian rarely step down on the back of a run of poor form from him or his team. After leading the Kolkata Knight Riders to victory in the Indian Premier League in 2012 and 2014, former Indian opening batsman Gautam Gambhir on Wednesday quit as captain of Delhi Daredevils citing non-performance and the team’s dismal run, in which they’ve suffered their fifth loss in six games this season. “I haven’t contributed enough to the team. As a leader of this ship, I take complete responsibility for where we are in the points table and I’ve decided to step down,” he said.

Daredevils coach Ricky Ponting says Gambhir deserves credit for the decision. “Taking a call like this isn’t heard of in India...I did the same thing when I was a player for Mumbai Indians.” Before Ponting in 2013 and Gambhir this year, seven other IPL skippers have relinquished captaincy mid-season.

Free from the rigours of captaincy, playing under Shreyas Iyer, will Gambhir return to the form that made him the IPL’s fourth-highest run-getter with 4,217 runs from 152 innings? For now, he is struggling, particularly against quick bowlers.

Gambhir’s decision is exceptional for another reason. According to the Press Trust of India, he may decide to forego his salary worth Rs 2.8 crore for the rest of the 2018 IPL season. Doing it in the middle of a league perceived as the preferred destination of global T20 mercenaries is rare. It reminds you of chief executives such as Hewlett Packard’s Meg Whitman, Google’s Larry Page, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and closer home, Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy, who decided to eschew their hefty pay packets in their desperation to steer their companies out of business slowdowns. Pulling Delhi out of the hole they’ve dug themselves in – at the bottom of the points table – may require more than a leadership change and a salary debit. But as a leader, Gambhir has set high standards for the next incumbent and other captains.",sport,https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/gautam-gambhir-s-stepping-down-will-be-a-tough-act-to-follow/story-aJSOrfRkqgAezNV7uT34JM.html

CHENNAI: It doesn’t matter if their batting line-up splutters its way to below-par scores. It doesn’t matter if injuries rule out front-line bowlers.

Thursday was the second time in this IPL — on the trot that too — when the SunRisers Hyderabad pulled off a Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill, punching their way out of low-total coffin to be the last team standing.

They may have benefitted from some benevolence shown by Lady Luck, but their successful defense of 118 (against Mumbai Indians, second-lowest in IPL history) and 132 (against Kings XI Punjab) despite the absence of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Billy Stanlake can be attributed to two factors: astute leadership from Kane Williamson, and the execution of those plans by his efficient bowling unit.“Both teams made a hash of their chases, but credit to SunRisers. Their bowling has been really good, and Williamson has been a really good leader. His captaincy is a major reason for their success,” agreed former India pacer Madan Lal.

Kane Williamson & Co

have defended low totals

twice without Bhuvneshwar

The approach that SunRisers have applied to pull off Houdini-like escapes in their last two clashes is perfect evidence of the aforementioned notion. Aided by a like-for-like replacement for Bhuvneshwar in Sandeep Sharma, Hyderabad tightened the screws on Mumbai within four overs, courtesy Evin Lewis and Ishan Kishan’s dismissals.As Rohit Sharma entered, Williamson smelt blood. Shakib Al Hasan was brought in as first change, and Shikhar Dhawan was installed at first slip, to exploit the outside-off-stump jitters that the Mumbai skipper tends to experience early in his innings.

SunRisers reaped instant dividends. Rohit’s waft at his first ball off Shakib nestled in Dhawan’s hands. Even as Krunal Pandya and Suryakumar Yadav biffed a few boundaries, Williamson played his trump card in the ninth over: Rashid Khan. That again yielded results. Aided by dot-ball pressure from Shakib at the other end, SunRisers made the run rate jump back above 7, with the leg-spinner scalping Krunal and Kieron Pollard.

Williamson sensed that he had his foot on the door, and brought in his wicket-takers: Siddarth Kaul and Basil Thampi. The latter claimed a set Suryakumar, and his Punjab counterpart added two more. Mumbai were reduced to 80/8 in 16 overs. The match had been sealed.Against Punjab, it was another masterstroke that sparked his team’s victory. Chris Gayle and KL Rahul had shaved off 55 runs from their target, before a Rashid beauty — which castled KL Rahul — gave SunRisers a whiff of hope. He decided to exploit the Achilles Heel of the Jamaican marauder in the very next over: short balls laced with pace.

Thampi was thrown the ball. He delivered with his second. Gayle was out for 22, undone by a quick bouncer. A hole had been sprung in Punjab’s ship.The Rashid-Shakib combo then suffocated their run rate, and ran through their middle-order. Sandeep, Kaul, and Thampi dusted off their tail. A 13-run win materialised from nowhere. “They have had their plans in place for all matches, and their execution has been top-notch. Rashid is outstanding, and he’s gotten excellent support,” elaborated Lal. “Williamson has an amazing bowling unit at his disposal, and he’s made use of them to their full potential.”

"After defending a meagre score of 132 against Kings XI Punjab, SunRisers Hyderabad skipper Kane Williamson praised his bowlers, saying the team is lucky to have local talent. Spin twins Rashid Khan and Shakib Al Hasan shared five wickets to help Hyderabad beat Punjab by 13 runs in a nail-biting Indian Premier League ( IPL ) match. ""The bowlers have been operating very well, they know their roles very well. We are fortunate with our bowling depth. Very lucky to have the local talent,"" Williamson said after the match. ""Some good tough decisions to make going into the next few matches. You always want more, but the boys have been fantastic in the way they fought with the ball especially on this kind of a pitch. We want to maintain the same trend for the rest of the tournament,"" he added.

Williamson also advised his batsmen to be a little more smarter.

""It's nice to be able to defend these totals. We didn't bowl well in the powerplay, but we did well to squeeze it towards the end. We want to be a little bit smarter with the bat. It's about getting 145s and 155s on these kind of surfaces. Competitive totals on these kind of surfaces,"" he said.

Demoted to No.3, Kings XI Punjab squandered a watchful 55-run opening start from Chris Gayle and Lokesh Rahul before falling apart, as Rashid (3/19) and Shakib (2/18) triggered a batting collapse to help their team win the match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday.",sport,https://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2018/ipl-2018-lucky-to-have-local-talent-says-sunrisers-hyderabad-skipper-kane-williamson-1843938
"Riding on wonder spinner Rashid Khan's brilliant effort, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) produced an inspired bowling display to eke out a fighting 13-run win over in-form Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) in a low-scoring Indian Premier League (IPL) match on Thursday.

Rashid (3/19)) turned out to be the star for Sunrisers once again as he along with Shakib (2/18) turned the tables around for the hosts in the middle overs after Manish Pandey's fighting 54 propelled them to 132 for six. Besides Rashid and Shakib, Basil Thampi (2/14) and Sandeep Sharma (2/17) also rose to the occasion for the home team.

Twitter was in awe of 19-year-old Rashid's exploits. Barring two games, against Kings Xi Punjab (where Gayle scored a hundred) and Chennai Super Kings, the Afghan has had a remarkable IPL 2018 so far.

Here are some tweets in his praise

I can’t stop watching @rashidkhan_19 do his thing! #compulsiveviewing @StarSportsIndia #selectdugout — Dean Jones (@ProfDeano) April 26, 2018

The @SunRisers can defend the undefendable. Rashid Khan is brilliant but the way Sid Kaul, Sandeep Sharma, Thampi exert and maintain pressure is fantastic. Great effort to defend this against Punjab #SRHvKXIP — Mohammad Kaif (@MohammadKaif) April 26, 2018

Rashid Khan is the first leg spinner I have seen who bowls leg spin from the back of the hand like you would bowl a googly. He gets his fingers to do that. Fascinating! — Sanjay Manjrekar (@sanjaymanjrekar) April 26, 2018

You can't predict what Rashid Khan or Mujeeb will bowl. You can predict that Afghans must be so proud of their success in this IPL. Super watching them.#SRHvKXIP — Sorabh Pant (@hankypanty) April 26, 2018

Rashid Khan is, well, simply brilliant! — Cricketwallah (@cricketwallah) April 26, 2018

Earlier, young Kings XI pacer Ankit Rajpoot (5/14) registered his career-best bowling figures to restrict Sunrisers to the modest score. But the total proved enough for Sunrisers as Kings XI batsmen crumbled like a pack of cards to fell short eventually and slump to their second loss in the tournament.

Chasing the modest target, openers KL Rahul (32) and Chris Gayle (23) got Kings XI's off to great start as the duo stitched quick 55 runs in just 47 balls. But just when it looked Kings XI will run away with the game, Afghan leg-spinner Rashid got the big breakthrough when he cleaned up Rahul with a gem of a delivery.

Big-hitting Gayle then miscued a short delivery off Thampi in the next over and the pacer accepted the chance of his own bowling. The two wickets derailed Kings XI's chase as Rashid and Shakib bowled brilliantly in the middle overs to keep Sunrisers afloat with wickets at regular intervals.

Rashid, in particular, was unplayable as the Kings XI batsmen completely failed to read his variations. Shakib accounted for Mayank Agarwal in the 13th over before Rashid outfoxed Karun Nair with a googly, caught plumb in front of the wicket.

Shakib then came back to dismiss dangerous Aaron Finch in the next over to make life difficult for Kings XI. Sandeep then dismissed Manoj Tiwary and Andrew Tye in the same over as Kings XI's chase fell apart.

Earlier, Rajpoot produced a dream opening spell, which included three important wickets, to dismantle Sunrisers innings after Kings XI opted to bowl first. The young pacer from Kanpur then returned back to pick up two more wickets in the final over to single-handedly destroy the home team.

For Sunrisers, Pandey (54 off 51) scored a fighting half-century, while Shakib (28) and Yusuf Pathan (21 not out) made useful contributions. On a roll, Kings XI had a dream start as they reduced Sunrisers to 27 for three by the end of the fifth over with Rajpoot reigning havoc.

Sunrisers top-order failed to cope up with Rajpoot's extra bounce and swing which resulted in the dismissal of Sunrisers captain Kane Williamson in the fourth ball of the innings, caught by skipper Ravichandran Ashwin. The pacer then removed Shikhar Dhawan (11) and Wriddhiman Saha (6) in his consecutive overs to put Sunrisers in serious trouble.

Rajpoot's extra bounce and swing first induced an edge from Dhawan which Nair gleefully accepted in the only slip and then in his next over the pacer removed Saha caught by Tye as the batsman went for a terrible cross-batted slog.

It could have been more trouble for the hosts but Tye dropped a dolly from Pandey off Rajpoot's next delivery to deny the bowler a hat-trick chance. Sunrisers received another reprieve when Shakib was caught off Barinder Sran in the next over off a no ball.

Riding on their luck, Pandey and Shakib then steadied Sunrisers sinking ship with a toiling 52-run partnership for the fourth wicket that came off 53 balls before young Afghanistan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman (1/17) cut short the association, getting the wicket of Shakib in the 14th over.

Even though Pandey toiled to his fifty but it was not enough as Rajpoot returned back in the final over to cut short his stay and then accounted for Mohammad Nabi a ball later to help Kings XI restrict Sunrisers to a chaseable target.

MI look for another season-reviving spark against arch-rivals CSK

Mumbai Indians making a false start in the Indian Premier League has been a recurring theme over the last few years. Mumbai Indians recovering dramatically from the rut to scrape their way through to the playoffs and potentially going on to win the title has also been a recurring theme in the IPL.

This time, it's no different. Confined closer to the bottom of the table after losing five out of their six games, MI find themselves in familiar territory. Their previous result against Sunrisers Hyderabad would have left them gutted and mentally sapped. But if there's something that can still provide them hope, it's the slender margin of some of their defeats - most of which could have been turned into victories.

One of them was against Chennai Super Kings in the tournament opener. Returning after a two-year suspension, CSK looked dead and buried before a Dwayne Bravo whirlwind cameo and a stubborn Kedar Jadhav gave them an extraordinary win. While Super Kings have gone onto build from that tense win to notch a few more in similar fashion, MI have only been on a downward spiral. Not only is their title defence at stake now, MI will also look to draw extra inspiration in order to get one over their arch rivals.

Perhaps, the biggest surprise would have been the inability of their powerful batting order to fire over and over again. The big money names Evin Lewis and Ishan Kishan have not delivered consistently and their skipper Rohit Sharma has had only one top knock so far. Kieron Pollard has looked way below his best whereas the Pandya brothers haven't done well either. Collectively, this batting unit needs a lift.

CSK, on the other hand, will look to arrest the middle-order wobble that has left them with too much to do at the death. Even though they have been successful more often than not in getting the job done, the focus will be on ensuring they don't crumble like they did against Mayank Markande in the first game. If they can also fine-tune their bowling attack to deliver as a unit like they did against Rajasthan Royals, Pune can become a fortress.

When: Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians, April 28, 20:00 IST

Where: Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Pune

What to expect: A full house considering MI fans only have to make a short trip to Pune. The pitch is full of runs according to CSK's bowling consultant Eric Simmons.

Team News:

Chennai Super Kings

Some of the second-choice players like David Willey, Faf du Plessis, Mark Wood, Murali Vijay were among the first ones to come out and practice with the big guns opting to rest. CSK are expected to be unchanged for this clash.

Probable XI: Shane Watson, Ambati Rayudu, Suresh Raina, Sam Billings, MS Dhoni (C & WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Dwayne Bravo, Harbhajan Singh, Shardul Thakur, Deepak Chahar, Imran Tahir

Mumbai Indians

There is a case for the Mumbai Indians to tinker around with their combination considering the recent results but since they've preferred to back their players even through this lean phase, it is unlikely they will make wholesale changes.

Probable XI: Evin Lewis, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan (WK), Rohit Sharma (C), Krunal Pandya, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mayank Markande, Jasprit Bumrah, Mustafizur Rahman/Adam Milne

Head to Head of teams

MI 12 - 11 CSK

Interesting face-offs

Raina/Dhoni vs Bumrah: Bmrah has dismissed Dhoni thrice in 27 balls, conceding just 34 runs. Raina has fallen to Bumrah twice in 22 balls, scoring 27 runs in the process.

Pollard vs Watson: Pollard has scored 67 runs off 28 balls from Watson, including nine fours and four sixes without getting dismissed (since IPL 2013).

Jadeja vs Mustafizur: Mustafizur has got the better of Jadeja, dismissing him thrice in 13 balls in IPL. In all international cricket, he has dismissed Jadeja thrice in 22 balls.

Approaching milestones

- Rohit Sharma needs three more sixes to become the first Asian player and seventh overall to hit 300 sixes in 20-over cricket.

Venue trends

In 13 IPL innings in Pune, Dhoni has scored 348 runs at 49.71 with a SR of 133.85 with a solitary fifty.

IPL 2018 trends

- MI have lost 20 wickets in the death overs which is the most for any team. Their scoring rate in these overs is 8.05, which is the lowest among all teams. They lose a wicket every 9.70 balls, which is the fewest for any team.

- CSK, on the other hand, have lost the fewest wickets in this phase - nine - and have the best scoring rate at 12.65.

What they said

""What we very strongly do in our review is to review the execution of whatever the plan is and not necessarily the outcome because we saw Siraj bowl wide yorkers to MS Dhoni and it went for six, sometimes that's the way it works so if we execute our plans as we wanted to, then we are happy."" - Eric Simmons, CSK bowling consultant.

""We haven't had the ideal start but one positive thing is that we have got eight games to go, we can still turn things around."" - Aditya Tare, MI wicketkeeper-batsman.

The Rohit Sharma-led side are lying at the seventh place in the eight-team points table after managing a single win from six games so far while CSK tops the chart with five wins from six matches. When the two sides met earlier in this year's league at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai, CSK had pipped Mumbai Indians by one wicket and with a ball to spare. Saturday's game will be a must-win encounter for Mumbai if they want to survive in the tournament. On the other hand, Chennai have once again shown why they are considered as the most successful IPL team and will be looking to continue their dream run in the league. Most of CSK batters - Shane Watson, Ambati Rayadu, Dwayne Bravo and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in form. Only Suresh Raina has failed to click and will be desperate to find his touch.While Rayudu has amassed 283 runs from six games, averaging 47.16, Dhoni and Watson have accumulated 209 and 191 runs respectively.

"Prithvi Shaw on Friday night proved once again that the quality of reserve pool of players in India is arguably the best in the world currently. The India Under-19 World Cup-winning captain produced a solid knock to score his maiden fifty in the IPL. Shaw, aged 18 years and 169 days, scored 62 off 44, including seven fours and two sixes, becoming the joint-youngest to score a half-century in the Indian Premier League . In 2013, Sanju Samson, playing for Rajasthan Royals , had smashed 63 off 41 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore aged 18 years and 169 days, eclipsing Shreevats Goswami (19 years and 1 day).

Shaw's teammate Rishabh Pant is second on the list having scored a half-century in 2017 at the age of 18 years and 212 days.

both at the age of 18y-169d#DDvKKR#IPL2018 — Mohandas Menon (@mohanstatsman) April 27, 2018

Shaw's half-century gave Delhi the perfect platform to launch a fierce attack at the back end of the innings. Newly-appointed DD captain Shreyas Iyer produced arguably the kncok of IPL 2018, smashing 93 off just 40 balls to power Delhi to 219 for four.

KKR made a feeble attempt to overhaul the target but were always chasing shadows after losing their top four batsmen within the powerplay overs. Shubman Gill (37 off 29 balls) played a handy knock and along with Andre Russell (44 off 30 balls) managed to keep the Kolkata outfit in the tie.

But a brilliant showing by DD bowlers at the death kept Russell under wraps and helped the Delhi franchise register a 55-run win -- their second in seven matches this season.

Shaw had joined the likes of Mohammad Kaif (2002), Virat Kohli (2008) and Unmukt Chand (2012) in leading India to the U-19 World Cup title. The Shaw-led team remained unbeaten in the 2018 U-19 World Cup as they brushed aside Australia in the final by eight wickets to bring the coveted trophy back to India.

Shaw scored 261 runs including two fifties during the tournament.

The stylish right-hander was picked up by the Daredevils in the IPL auction but was not played in DD's first five matches of the season.

The India Under-19 World Cup-winning captain produced a solid knock to score his maiden fifty in the IPL. Shaw, aged 18 years and 169 days, scored 62 off 44, including seven fours and two sixes, becoming the joint-youngest to score a half-century in the Indian Premier League . In 2013, Sanju Samson, playing for Rajasthan Royals , had smashed 63 off 41 balls against Royal Challengers Bangalore aged 18 years and 169 days, eclipsing Shreevats Goswami (19 years and 1 day).

Shaw's teammate Rishabh Pant is second on the list having scored a half-century in 2017 at the age of 18 years and 212 days.

Youngest to register a score of 50+ in #IPL history!

Shaw's half-century gave Delhi the perfect platform to launch a fierce attack at the back end of the innings. Newly-appointed DD captain Shreyas Iyer produced arguably the kncok of IPL 2018, smashing 93 off just 40 balls to power Delhi to 219 for four.

KKR made a feeble attempt to overhaul the target but were always chasing shadows after losing their top four batsmen within the powerplay overs. Shubman Gill (37 off 29 balls) played a handy knock and along with Andre Russell (44 off 30 balls) managed to keep the Kolkata outfit in the tie.

But a brilliant showing by DD bowlers at the death kept Russell under wraps and helped the Delhi franchise register a 55-run win -- their second in seven matches this season.

Shaw had joined the likes of Mohammad Kaif (2002), Virat Kohli (2008) and Unmukt Chand (2012) in leading India to the U-19 World Cup title. The Shaw-led team remained unbeaten in the 2018 U-19 World Cup as they brushed aside Australia in the final by eight wickets to bring the coveted trophy back to India.

Shaw scored 261 runs including two fifties during the tournament.

The stylish right-hander was picked up by the Daredevils in the IPL auction but was not played in DD's first five matches of the season.

"New skipper Shreyas Iyer hammers unbeaten 93 while teen Prithvi Shaw scores 62 as Delhi beat Kolkata by 55 runs



Delhi's Prithvi Shaw departs after his maiden T20 fifty yesterday

It required two Mumbaikars — new skipper Shreyas Iyer and teenager Prithvi Shaw — to revive the fortunes of Delhi in T20-11. Iyer, despite being burdened with leading a struggling team, played an innings which will be remembered for a long time. His unbeaten 93, which included 28 from the final over of the innings, ensured that Delhi posted 219-4, the highest score in this T20 season.

Iyer, Shaw run riot

Iyer's blistering knock came after Shaw had become the youngest player to register a half-century in the mega-event. His 62, in only his second T20 game, was the platform on which Iyer built a huge total which Kolkata' batsmen found too tough to overhaul. Pressured by the task of getting to the target at 11 an over, Kolkata lost early wickets and with it, the plot. It was left to Andre Russell to make a fight of it with a hard-struck 44. But his effort went in vain as KKR fell 55 runs short in the end. The comprehensive victory enabled Delhi move a notch up from the bottom of the points table.

Last-over mayhem

Earlier, the murderous assault Iyer launched at the bowling in the fag end of the innings was scintillating. In the last over by Shivam Mavi, he struck the young pacer for four sixes and a four. The over accrued 29 runs, which virtually sealed the fate of the match.

Prithvi Shaw announced his arrival in the IPL with a maiden half-century for Delhi Daredevils against Kolkata Knight Riders on Friday. Courtesy of his sublime knock of 62, Shaw (18y 169d) also became the joint youngest to score a fifty in IPL. Sanju Samson had also scored fifty at the same age in 2013. Shaw has had a glittering career so far scoring 5 centuries in 10 first-class matches and winning the Under-19 World Cup as captain, all of it at just 18 years of age. This inning will only continue to enhance his reputation.

Opening the batting for Daredevils, Shaw began cautiously but once he got his eye in, he stroked the ball beautifully to score at a brisk pace. Playing proper cricketing shots the youngster slammed 7 fours and 2 sixes. He reached his fifty 37 deliveries before eventually getting out for a 44-ball 62.

However, what was most impressive about Shaw’s knock was the way he took on veteran Aussie pacer, Mitchell Johnson and hit a terrific six over long on. His shot also had a striking similarity to Dhoni’s helicopter shot.

How times change. A few years ago a little Prithvi Shaw would have watched in awe as Mitch Johnson terrorised batsmen. Now, with the passage of time, he is hitting him on the rise over cover — Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) 27 April 2018

Along with newly appointed skipper Shreyas Iyer, Shaw forged a run partnership to give DD the ideal platform to soar past the 200-run mark. Iyer also had a day to remember after scoring an unbeaten 93, which is the highest score by any individual on captain debut.

Six-time champions India have never dropped a game in the Asia Cup in all the previous editions (across formats) © BCCI

Keeping in mind the preparation for the ICC Women's World T20 later this year, India have named a full-strength 15-member squad for the ACC Women's Asia Cup T20, to be played in Malaysia from June 1.

Veteran medium-pace all-rounder Rumeli Dhar misses out after having last played against Australia in the T20I tri-series opener in Mumbai last month. Dhar, who made her international comeback after a six-year hiatus, in South Africa, didn't feature in the remaining three games of the series for India. The hosts failed to qualify for the final of the tri-series, having won only one [against England] of their four games.

Spin pair of Ekta Bisht and Rajeshwari Gayakwad, who both missed India's last assignment in the format, returned for the succeeding ODIs against England and have now been included in the T20I squad. Teenaged left-arm spinner Radha Yadav, who came in as a replacement for the injured pair, misses out.

The tournament that will feature defending champions India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and hosts Malaysia, will be held from June 1 to June 11, 2018. Each team will play against all five opponents once, and the top-two sides will clash in the final. Six-time champions India have never dropped a game in the Asia Cup in all the previous editions (across formats).

All matches involving Thailand and Malaysia will still not be counted as T20Is as the latest development announced by the ICC - that all their members will have international status in the shortest format - shall take effect from July 1, 2018 for women's cricket.

Squad: Harmanpreet Kaur(c), Smriti Mandhana (vc), Mithali Raj, Veda Krishnamurthy, Jemimah Rodrigues, Anuja Patil, Deepti Sharma, Taniya Bhatia (wk), Poonam Yadav, Jhulan Goswami, Ekta Bisht, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Shikha Pandey, Pooja Vastrakar and Mona Meshram.

"They say that if you’re lucky enough to be Irish, then you’re lucky enough. The Irish are famous for their cultural symbols recognised and celebrated across the world. But apart from their proverbial luck, the colour green and St. Patrick’s Day, it’s a zest for life that truly defines the Irish.

Don’t be alarmed if you hear the Irish talking about “crack”. Craic, pronounced ‘Krak’, is a popular Irish expression that can’t be defined but can only be experienced. “What’s the craic” could mean many things. It’s used break the ice with a stranger, to catch up with a friend or even to say - “let’s have some fun.”

The Irish are known for their warmth and friendliness. So much so that during the Euro 2016, Irish football fans were charming their way through a rival country, making friends wherever they went and spreading joy through various good deeds. Being Irish is about celebrating life and to be a part of the festivity, all you need to do is visit an Irish pub. Always buzzing with music, stories and laughter, the pub is a great place to experience the essence of Irish culture.

While the history of Ireland made its people tenacious, they’ve also embraced the light-hearted side of life. This combination of courage and a sense of humour can be observed in everything they do. “It’ll be grand, sure!”, is an Irish saying that captures this spirit – take a shot, give it a go, whatever happens, life will be great.

The Irish have a knack for sharing and creating stories; and it is said that Irish stories are always long and never dull. It’s not surprising then that stories like the legend of Halloween, which originated in Ireland, are not only known but celebrated all over the world. In an Irish pub, you’ll invariably find yourself immersed in a tale, with every other person adding a twist to the story. Don’t be surprised if what you assumed to be fiction turns out to be true, as seen in this video.

Play

From thrilling tales of Irish lads that travel from pub to pub, to the making music with anything and everything at your disposal, being Irish means being up for anything. The Irish way is incomplete without their brand of music that reverberates through family dinners, pub sessions, the streets…wherever you can pull up a stool. What gives a Trad Session in a traditional Irish pub its distinctive flavour is that there is no stage separating musicians from the listeners and anyone is welcome to join in. Jameson, a brand that has bottled the Irish spirit, has captured moments of pure Irish-ness in these short videos.

Play

Distilled in Ireland, Jameson is an integral part of the Irish social experience. In its company, one can truly sense the camaraderie of a group of lads having a night out. Whether you are in a pub or in the depths of a forest, if you’re in the company of lads, rest assured, you’re in for some adventure and a lot of craic.

"Hockey India (HI) on Friday made a rather unexpected move, reappointing goalkeeper PR Sreejesh as the captain of the Indian men's hockey team till the end of the year while taking it away from midfielder Manpreet Singh.

While a captain's role on the field is mostly restricted to sporting the captain's armband with the coach calling all the shots, the timing of this decision makes it assume a little more significance.

This is the first major change within the team after India's disappointing fourth-place finish at the 2018 Commonwealth Games (CWG) at Gold Coast.

Many senior players within the set-up were not too optimistic about coach Sjoerd Marijne's policy of throwing a lot of youngsters into the senior national team, as was the case at the 2018 CWG.

Thus, handing over the leadership role to the 29-year-old Sreejesh — the most experienced player in the team currently — can be seen as a corrective measure taken by the team management ahead of some crucial tournaments later this year, like the Asian Games and FIH World Cup.

""Sreejesh has plenty of experience, and his leadership can get the team back on track after the poor CWG show. This is not to say that Manpreet was not good as captain but Sreejesh has much more experience than him, and will guide the youngsters in the team better,"" a HI official said, without wishing to be named.

Interestingly, the HI selection committee chairman Harbinder Singh, who is in Bhopal for the junior women national championship, was unaware of this change of guard.

""I am not aware about this decision, and neither was I consulted. So, the team management must have decided for this change,"" Singh said.

It will be interesting to see if Sreejesh actually wears the captain's armband. In hockey, a captain can be sent off for a stipulated amount of time by the umpires if any player in the team is found guilty of serious infringement or on-field misconduct.

In such a scenario, losing the main goalkeeper can be detrimental to any team, more so in India's case, with Sreejesh's class in front of the goal being second to none.

That was the reason why former coach Roelant Oltmans used to rotate the captain's armband among various players in different matches during his tenure, despite naming Sreejesh as the captain on paper before the tournament.

Sreejesh was first appointed captain before the Champions Trophy in 2016, before replacing Sardar Singh as the full-time captain ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics.

A knee injury during the 2017 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup sidelined him for eight months, during which Manpreet was given the captaincy.

Meanwhile, Rani will continue to lead the women's team till the end of the year.",sport,http://www.dnaindia.com/sports/report-hockey-india-pr-sreejesh-reappointed-captain-chief-selector-unaware-2609424

"Several players had widely criticised the coach’s selection policies, some of which backfired during the CWG. Several players had widely criticised the coach’s selection policies, some of which backfired during the CWG.

A fortnight after the Commonwealth Games debacle, the men’s hockey team reassembled in Bangalore with a new captain and sans the coach. On Friday, as the camp got underway at the SAI South Centre, Hockey India named PR Sreejesh as the captain for the remainder of the year. The goalkeeper takes over the reins from centre-half Manpreet Singh, who was one of the few bright spots for India in Gold Coast. However, there’s stoic silence on Sjoerd Marijne’s continuity as the chief coach.

A key decision-maker, who has held multiple meetings this week, said an announcement on the Dutchman’s future is imminent over the weekend. A final meeting of Hockey India officials is expected to take place on Saturday and the role of high performance director David John, too, being scrutinised. Curiously, with the camp underway and his role is being examined by his employers, Marijne is in Holland. After a short break post the Commonwealth Games, he was scheduled to return in time for the camp but ‘visa issues’ have delayed his arrival. When contacted, Marijne refused to comment on the issue.

Marijne’s position came under scanner after India endured one of its most lackluster tournaments in recent years at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games earlier this month. The team was stretched in every match, including by minnows Wales, and eventually finished fourth – their worst finish since the 2006 edition. As much as the result, the performance of the team too has drawn a lot of flak. A senior official, who has been conducting the post-mortem this week, said it was a matter of concern that the team looked so disjointed despite the facilities provided to them. “They have been given world-class facilities to train and there have been no shortage of matches to prepare. We have spoken to the players and changes are already made there. A decision on the coach should have been taken by now but we will make an announcement over the weekend,” the official said.

The players, it is learnt, are not entirely happy with Marijne’s philosophies. A senior member of the team said the coach’s inexperience of managing a team in big events was felt at the Commonwealth Games, which was Marijne’s first major assignment since taking charge last October. The Dutch coach’s player-driven approach and selection policy, too, have been criticised. “There were too many young players included for the CWG; that process should have been gradual. Also, since most of us did not play a tournament going before the Games, the lack of match practice was evident. All other teams, including Australia and England, sent full-strength teams for Azlan Shah while we were at the camp. So his planning wasn’t up to mark and that’s where his inexperience as coach showed,” a team member said.

Defiant coach

Marijne has defended his policies, insisting that ‘one bad tournament does not mean they restructure their whole approach.’ However, it is believed that current women’s team coach Harendra Singh is already seen as a replacement if Marijne is shown the door this weekend. Harendra led the junior national team to World Cup title at home in 2016. With a little more than six months to go before India hosts the senior World Cup, Harendra’s familiarity with the men’s team as well as the opponents puts him in pole position for the role. Where that will leave the women’s team, who have a World Cup of their own in July, remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the decision to replace Manpreet as the captain is seen as a cosmetic move to paper the cracks. Apart from Sreejesh and SV Sunil, Manpreet was the only other player who had some impact in the tournament. It is widely believed that the burden of leading a young side was severely impacting Manpreet’s game and his leadership qualities were being questioned, especially in pressure situations. But merely making Sreejesh the leader will not solve India’s on-field woes.

Whether the change of leadership is the only outcome of the Gold Coast debacle, or if it will end up costing Marijne his job, remains to be seen.

"Hockey India reinstated goalkeeper PR Sreejesh as captain of the men's team till December.

Back to full fitness after his knee surgery and having done well under the bar in the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, Sreejesh replaced Manpreet Singh. This is being viewed in hockey circles with eyebrows raised as Manpreet was among the few players who did well in Gold Coast.

Hockey India also named Rani Rampal as captain of the women's team till December.

On Saturday, Hockey India will be holding a meeting in the Capital to discuss the Gold Coast disaster, where the men's team failed to win a medal. At the same time, they will also discuss the future of coach Sjoerd Marijne.

It's almost three weeks after the CWG ended and probable list for the next camp have been announced, with Sardar Singh back in the mix. Coach Marijne is currently in Holland on a holiday.

Mail Today has learnt that apart from officials of the Hockey India, high performance director David John will also be attending the meeting. It is well known that John is more of a physiologist and exercise expert who was elevated as high performance director after a change in job profile of Roelant Oltmans three years ago.

Once Oltmans was made coach of the men's team, John stepped into his role. Oltmans was sacked last year and his replacement Marijne is now facing tense moments as the team did not do well this year.

One can well argue the team sent to the Azlan Shah tournament was not the best one, but when the high priests in Hockey India pour over data, they would have dissected everything.

These days, when the team has video analysts, sophisticated replays and plenty of information on each player, there will be a lot to analyse. All those who saw the matches on television will agree India fumbled despite creating chances. Field chances were missed and the penalty corner conversion rate was abysmal.

Yes, players will be blamed but they have had their way in the past. As a result, foreign coaches were sacrificed.

Hockey India's hire and fire policy is nothing new. The history of coaches who were sacked is huge and if Marijne is going to expect sympathy, that may not happen. There are also reports doing rounds that Marijne was given a free hand in team selection.

The team failed in two tournaments and with the Champions Trophy, Asian Games and World Cup to be held this year till December, Indian hockey needs to get back to winning ways.

Till now, coaches who had to leave were made to feel lousy. On Saturday, David John may have his hands full while dealing with Hockey India bosses. He has seen exits before, unless he, too, decides he will not work in this kind of system.

The point is, if Manpreet Singh can be sacked, Marijne too can come under the axe. For those who wonder from which country India will get a new coach from, the job market offers options. At least, that's what we are made to believe.

In case you need a stop-gap coach, don't be surprised even if an Indian (Harendra Singh) takes charge for a short period. Indian hockey never ceases to spring surprises, away from the field!",sport,https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/pr-sreejesh-replaces-manpreet-singh-as-india-hockey-captain-harendra-could-be-stop-gap-coach-1222134-2018-04-28
"An embattled Mumbai Indians' fight for survival in the ongoing Indian Premier League begins at Chennai Super Kings' adopted home ground on Saturday, an uphill task given their opponents' form and formidable line-up.

The heartbreaking one-wicket defeat in the lung-opener is fresh in their minds but Mumbai Indians will have to play out of their skins to exact revenge at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

At the Wankhede in Mumbai earlier this month, CSK had defeated the defending champions by one wicket, and with a ball to spare.MI are too keen to get back to winning ways after two straight reverses.

It has been a journey of contrasts for the two teams so far. While Mumbai have managed only one win in their six matches, the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led outfit has won five of their six games.

The shifting of games from their original home did not affect Chennai as they won their first match in Pune.

For Mumbai, to survive in the tournament, this is a must-win encounter.

Mumbai batters have struggled in the tournament, barring Suryakumar Yadav.

Skipper Rohit Sharma has failed to fire in five of the six games and so is Kieron Pollard.

But if Rohit, Pollard, Surya, Evin Lewis and Hardik Pandya fire in unison, Mumbai can set up or chase big totals. And coach Mahela Jayawardane would expect all to score heavily tomorrow.

Save his match-winning 94 against Royal Challengers Banglore, Rohit has failed to get past 20 runs in five games. He would be hoping to turn the tables and get some runs under his belt.

Rohit's batting position will also be crucial and MI can ask him to open and bring Surya at number 4.

Even in terms of bowling, MI have failed to perform as a unit. When one performed exceedingly well, he lacked support from the other end.

The 20-year-old leggie Mayank Markande has been the find for MI and he has grabbed 10 wickets from six games.

But others like 'death overs' specialist Jasprit Bumrah and Bangladesh pacer Muztifizur Rahman have not lived up to the expectations. If the star-studded CSK batting line-up has to be restricted, the two will have to play their part to perfection.

Mumbai can also look at bringing in New Zealand pacer Adam Milne for his compatriot Mitchell McClehaghan, who is leaking runs, especially in the end.

On the other hand, Chennai would take confidence from their last win when a vintage Dhoni helped the team chase a stiff target of 206 against RCB.

Chennai would be pleased that most of their batters Australian Shane Watson, Ambati Rayadu, Dwayne Bravo, Dhoni are in form.Only Suresh Raina has been out of form and he would be keen to be among the runs.

Coach Stephen Fleming would expect another stellar performance from his batters on a pitch that usually aids the batsmen.

The Chennai bowling, led by Shardul Thakur and complemented by Imran Tahir, Deepak Chahar, has also clicked so far.

While Mumbai will be under extreme pressure to deliver, another win for Chennai would consolidate their position in the table.

"By PTI

MUMBAI: Former India batsman Lalchand Rajut believes that Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma should open the innings for the defending champions as it can give the team a good start.

""Rohit is a prolific opening batsman, who has done exceptionally well for India as an opener. So opening and playing free is important for him. If you start well, then you can pile up a big score. You have to open with Rohit, as simple as that,"" Rajput told PTI.

""When you bat at number four after losing two wickets that is a different ball-game rather than opening. It (Rohit opening the innings) will help Mumbai, because they will get a good start, as the start is important,"" the former Mumbai opener added.

Three times champion MI, who have lost five of the six games, have opted to open with West Indian Evin Lewis and Suryakumar Yadav, with wicket-keeper Ishan Kishan coming one-down. Rohit has been coming to bat at number four.

""But Rohit is such a player, once he gets 30s, he makes it big,"" Rajput, a domestic bulwark, said.

In the six games played so far, except his

match-winning knock of 94 against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rohit has not even gone past the score of 20.

Rajput, former coach of Afghanistan, also said that West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard has been ""struggling""

and MI can look at South African J P Duminy as an option.

""If a certain player is not doing well, you have to look at it. He (Pollard) is not in good form and has not (performed) well. It is time that they (MI) look for another options and (JP) Duminy is another option,"" added Rajput.

Thirty-year-old Pollard has miserably failed with the bat as his highest score in the five games this season has been 28.

MI will now clash with Chennai Super Kings on Saturday in Pune and will seek to take revenge after their defeat against the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side at the Wankhede Stadium here.",sport,http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/ipl/2018/apr/28/rohit-sharma-should-open-for-mumbai-indians-lalchand-rajput-1807310.html
"Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) ended up on the losing side on Thursday but their pacer Ankit Rajpoot produced a stellar bowling performance, taking this IPL 2018's maiden five-wicket haul.

Rajpoot’s take five

It could easily go down as the ball of the season. There was pace, disconcerting bounce and prodigious movement, enough to trouble the best in the business.

When uncapped fast bowler Ankit Rajpoot unleashed that superlative delivery to Shikhar Dhawan in the third over of Sunrisers Hyderabad’s innings, the experienced opener was all at sea. He ended up edging the ball to Karun Nair at first slip.

This was Rajpoot’s moment of reckoning. Despite toiling away for years on domestic circuit’s unresponsive tracks for Uttar Pradesh, he has remained largely anonymous. Even after getting selected by the Chennai Super Kings for two consecutive seasons did not guarantee him a spot in the playing XI. That did not dampen the Kanpur’s lad spirits. If anything, it pepped him up further to continue with his impressive and whole-hearted performances in first-class cricket.

On Thursday evening at Uppal, the stars aligned ever so perfectly for the fast bowler. For starters, he got a pitch that had pace, zip and enough bounce to keep him interested for his entire duration of four overs. Before he had orchestrated Dhawan’s dismissal, the fast bowler had prised out Kane Williamson, Sunrisers captain in his first over. He then followed it up with a beautiful slower delivery to dismiss Wriddhiman Saha.

Also read: Ankit Rajpoot takes first five-for of Indian Premier League 11

The pacer had barely warmed up by then. He returned for his final spell to account for Manish Pandey and Mohammad Nabi to finish with figures of 4-0-14-5.

This was the best bowling analysis by a bowler in this edition of the IPL, and Rajpoot’s efforts eclipsed the tournament’s previous best figures of 4/23, achieved by Mumbai Indians’ leg-spinner Mayank Markande.

The standout aspect of Rajpoot’s spell was that he did not get carried away by the purchase he got from the Uppal track. Instead, he kept things simple and even brought about a slew of slower deliveries and back-of-the hand deceptions that tied Hyderabad’s batsmen in knots. Rajpoot’s rich haul was instrumental in Punjab restricting the Sunrisers to a middling score of 132/6.

This IPL is peppered with instances of lesser-known domestic pacers putting their hands up to be counted on the big stage. Apart from Rajpoot’s exploits tonight, Chennai’s Deepak Chahar and Hyderabad’s Siddharth Kaul are some of the other success stories so far.

Sunriser’s Perfect 10

Kings XI Punjab would have been a happy bunch at the half-way stage. Most would have expected them to wipe off 133 without much fuss. More so, because Chris Gayle, their talisman was back in the playing XI after sitting out of the last game against Delhi Daredevils. But Sunrisers have shown in the past that they are a pretty formidable — with their clinical bowling attack, buoyed by their effervescent fielding — when it comes to defending low targets.

Couple of nights ago, they knocked out Mumbai Indians for a paltry 87, after scoring just 118. However, seven overs into the chase, it looked like a fairly open-and-shut case. Punjab’s openers Chris Gayle and KL Rahul had raced to 50 and were well on course to register what looked like a comfortable win. Inexplicably, they imploded.

Against the run of play, Rashid Khan, Kane Williamson’s bowling lynchpin, bowled the perfect googly to clean up Rahul. When Basil Thampi removed Chris Gayle in the following over, Punjab panicked.

Once again, Hyderabad’s bowlers were supported by their fielders. Some stunning catches were plucked on the boundary ropes and Punjab lost eight wickets for just 62 runs to hand Williamson’s men a thrilling 13-run win.

The league, however, will have no impact on the Shpageeza Cricket League and it will continue to be played in Afghanistan. Shafiqullah Stanikzai, the CEO, felt the league will help Afghanistan's home-grown cricketers showcase their talent. ""It has been a unifying tool, contributing to peace, development and stability in the country. It will open the doors for youngsters inside the country and around the globe.

Chewed up, spitted out and left to fend for himself; Chris Gayle's future in the Indian Premier League (IPL) looked uncertain after he was not retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) ahead of the players' auction. And, when he went unsold after failing to find suitors in the initial bidding rounds, it seemed that the Indian fans might not witness the 'Gayle-storm' this season.



But, an unlikely bid from Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) eventually saved the day for both Gayle and IPL fans. The Jamaican marauder had finally found a team that was willing to buy him, even if it was for his base price of Rs 2 crore. While many thought Punjab had probably made a mistake by investing in Gayle, the 'Universe Boss' eventually made the naysayers eat their own words.



Tipped as cricketer who was old and past his prime, Gayle reminded everyone that you can never count out a player of his calibre. After being left out in the first two games, Gayle marked his KXIP debut with a blistering 33-ball 63 that helped his side beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK). In the next match, he went bonkers against Sunrisers Hyderabad in his unbeaten 63-ball 104 in Mohali.

His brilliant ton - first by a batsman this season - was followed by another gem of an innings where he smashed a 38-ball 62. His only failure, a 22-ball 23, came against Hyderabad in Punjab's last game where his side slumped to a surprising 13-run loss.



Playing in just four games so far, Gayle has amassed 252 runs including an unbeaten hundred and two fifties. And, the fact that he has smashed 14 fours and 23 sixes is one of the reasons why Punjab have looked so convincing this season. For a man who failed to garner the interest of numerous franchises, Gayle has undoubtedly taken the IPL by storm this season on the back of sublime performances. Thus, it was only fair to see him celebrate his marauding run in style in Goa.

Chris Gayle has added some excitement to an otherwise dull IPL match-up between Hyderabad and Punjab with some cheeky on-field antics.

The batsman put on his best wicket keeper impression during the changeover, making for a playful display that delighted the crowd.

Hyderabad successfully defended another low total in the IPL for the second match in a row, beating the Kings by 13 runs.

Punjab's powerful batting lineup, which included the in-form Chris Gayle and Lokesh Rahul up front, was bowled out for 119 in 19.2 overs.

IPL star cops ball to the face

That was while chasing Hyderabad's 6-132, which owed some to Punjab's poor fielding which resulted in Mujeeb Ur Rahman copping a ball to the face.

""It's nice to defend these totals, but we want to be smarter with the bat,"" Hyderabad captain Kane Williamson said.

""It's not about getting 180 always; get 145, 155, and we can use our bowling to put them under pressure.""

Hyderabad top-scorer Manish Pandey was dropped three times while making 54, and Yusuf Pathan (21 not out) also got a life in his 21 not out.

""From where we were, we should have put this game away. It's disappointing,"" Punjab captain Ravichandran Ashwin said.

""We let ourselves down in the field as well ... always difficult to catch under lights, but there are no excuses. We are professionals and we have to work harder to get back in.""",sport,https://wwos.nine.com.au/2018/04/27/10/13/chris-gayle-ipl-t20

AB de Villiers garners a huge fan following in India.

De Villiers took his wife and son out for an auto rickshaw ride in Bengaluru ahead of Royal Challengers Bangalore's match against Kolkata Knight Riders at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Sunday.

While they enjoyed the ride, the family was followed by some ""avid"" fans on motorcycles and scooters saying, ""Ee Sala Cup Namde"".

""Ee Sala Cup Namde"" is the RCB slogan for the Indian Premier League this season and has been a rage among Bengaluru fans.

De Villiers is one of the mainstays of the RCB batting line-up along with captain Virat Kohli.

The South African legend is a bowler's nightmare when on song.

De Villiers also known as 'Mr 360' has been in terrific form this season but has found lack of support from the bowling unit.

He is currently the second highest run-getter with 280 runs from 6 matches so far with the help of three fifties.

The South African ace produced another gem of an innings on Wednesday but his efforts was trumped by MS Dhoni's magnificent knock that helped Chennai Super Kings pull of a record chase against RCB at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

ABD had recently smashed his highest score while chasing when his unbeaten 90 off just 39 deliveries powered RCB past Delhi Daredevils at home last Sunday.

De Villiers took his wife and son out for an auto rickshaw ride in Bengaluru ahead of Royal Challengers Bangalore's match against Kolkata Knight Riders at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Sunday.

While they enjoyed the ride, the family was followed by some ""avid"" fans on motorcycles and scooters saying, ""Ee Sala Cup Namde"".

""Ee Sala Cup Namde"" is the RCB slogan for the Indian Premier League this season and has been a rage among Bengaluru fans.

De Villiers is one of the mainstays of the RCB batting line-up along with captain Virat Kohli.

The South African legend is a bowler's nightmare when on song.

De Villiers also known as 'Mr 360' has been in terrific form this season but has found lack of support from the bowling unit.

He is currently the second highest run-getter with 280 runs from 6 matches so far with the help of three fifties.

The South African ace produced another gem of an innings on Wednesday but his efforts was trumped by MS Dhoni's magnificent knock that helped Chennai Super Kings pull of a record chase against RCB at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

ABD had recently smashed his highest score while chasing when his unbeaten 90 off just 39 deliveries powered RCB past Delhi Daredevils at home last Sunday.

The 34-year-old has amassed 3753 runs from 135 matches so far in the competition with the help of 3 centuries and 25 half-centuries.",sport,https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/story/watch-ab-de-villiers-takes-his-wife-and-son-out-for-an-auto-rickshaw-ride-in-bengaluru-what-happened-next-1221323-2018-04-27
"South Africa's batting great AB de Villiers on Moday said Virat Kohli has been fantastic as captain of Royal Challengers Bangalore, proving his mettle time and again under difficult circumstances.

""The true judge of a good captain is when you don't perform well and still do a good job while leading a side. He has come through with flying colours when it comes to that. He has been a fantastic captain for us,"" de Villiers told media at an event here.

De Villiers said Kohli is putting a lot of effort and energy to keep the side in good stead in the training sessions and hopes he scores a lot many runs in the remainder of the IPL.

Asked whether he and Kohli feels the pressure when other batsmen fails to score runs, de Villiers said: ""It is normal to feel pressure because we are international players. However, I don't feel extra pressure, I don't think Virat feels it either. We have a team of match-winners and it is up to us to share the load.""

The South African run machine said won't be surprised if a couple of youngsters come through with flying colours in the ongoing IPL.

""In the last five years or so I have seen a lot of talent coming through. I see youngsters playing without any fear so I won't be surprised if a couple of players come through.

MI can turn things around

Defending champions Mumbai Indians have lost four games out of the first give they have played, but captain Rohit Sharma on Monday expressed optimism that things could be turned around as has been the case in the past.

""So far whatever is happening with MI, it is not going the way we want to. But I think we will turn things around like we have done it in the past. Hopefully, we can turn it around this time,"" Rohit said on Monday at a book release function.

He was referring to the 2015 season when MI lost five out of their first six matches before making a stunning late charge to their second IPL title.",sport,http://www.dailypioneer.com/sports/kohli-has-been-fantastic-captain-ab.html

"Under their newly appointed captain Dinesh Karthik, the Kolkata Knight Riders have given a fair account of themselves so far in VIVO IPL 2018. The wicketkeeper-batsman has led KKR to three wins from six games – each of those wins being of convincing margins.

After a 5-day break, KKR return to action on Friday evening when they take on the Delhi Daredevils at the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground. Rather than depending on one or two individuals to score the runs, KKR have had contributions from several batsmen so far in their journey; Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Nitish Rana and Chris Lynn have made half-centuries, while Robin Uthappa has chipped in with useful contributions. However, the team’s top run-getter this season is their captain Dinesh Karthik, who despite batting at number five, has scored useful runs every time he has walked out to bat.

Reflecting on his batting form and his consistent contributions with the bat, Karthik, who interacted with the media on Thursday evening said, “It is just the way I have been preparing, getting ready for the games, I have been consistent in my thought process and that has helped me remain in the same space consistently.”

Karthik is himself in a new role – having been appointed as captain of an IPL team for the first time since 2014. In these last six games, the 32-year old has shown that he has enjoyed the challenges that come with captaincy. When asked about the leadership role, what he had learnt from it, and how it had changed him as a person, Karthik explained that after being made captain he had started to deal with people differently and his thought process had changed. “I think it has changed my approach towards a lot of people. I am thinking for ten other people on the ground a lot of the time; what they are thinking, how can I get the best out of them, etc.

Karthik also explained the difference in thought process between a regular player and how a captain would think. “If you are just a player, you are only thinking about yourself and trying to get the best out of yourself.That’s what the team needs.Whereas as a captain you are thinking for a few more people and trying to figure out what’s the best way to get the best effort out of a certain player in a certain situation.That’s what I am always thinking. You empathize a lot more when you’re captain.”

Though these are early days, Karthik’s record as captain-batsman in IPL make for impressive reading. While he averages 24.72 with the bat as a player, in the 12 matches he has been captain, his batting average has shot up to 35.30. Karthik has also scored his runs quicker while being captain; his strike-rate as captain is 133.20 as against 125.75 as a player.",sport,https://www.iplt20.com/news/126617/captaincy-has-changed-my-approach-towards-others-says-kkr-captain-karthik
"is unsure of the welcome he will receive on his final visit to Old as Arsenal boss tomorrow after many ""great battles"" against Manchester United during his two decades in charge.

The 68-year-old Frenchman, leaving the club at the end of the season, will bring a side that is a pale shadow of the team that challenged United's dominance during his first decade in charge.

Wenger's clashes with former United boss are the stuff of legend and his relationship with has been laced with bitterness.

But both men have reached out to him with warm words since he announced he was stepping down.

Mourinho said he regrets some of the ""little negative episodes"" between himself and Wenger over the years, calling on United fans to give him a fitting send-off.

When asked whether he could be friends with Mourinho, Wenger spoke instead of ""respect"" for the current United boss.

Arsenal, in sixth spot in the league, look certain to miss out on the top four for the second year in a row.

But Wenger will still believe he can leave the club with a trophy and a spot despite conceding a late goal in a 1-1 home draw with Atletico Madrid in the on Thursday.

The Frenchman is unsure how he will be greeted at Old Trafford, where he is unlikely to play a first-choice side with the second leg of the tie looming next week.

""I don't know what reaction I will get but look we had some great battles in 22 years and for me what will be at stake is to recover from that result (against Atletico) and before we go to Atletico have a good game,"" Wenger said.

- Sanchez reunion -



===================



The Frenchman, who says he is not ready to retire from football, is likely to face a side including former Gunners star Alexis Sanchez, who left to join United in the January transfer window.

The Chilean's presence in the opposing team will be a painful reminder to Arsenal fans of Wenger's inability in recent years to convince many of his best players to buy into his project and stay.

Wenger said he was so committed to Arsenal that he even declined an approach by then United when Ferguson was mulling retiring in 2001.

""Arsenal is the love of my life. I turned many, many, many clubs down to face the challenge when we built the stadium,"" said Wenger, referring to the Emirates.

""I speak to everybody, yes I met Martin Edwards, many people came to see me but I was always loyal to this club."" ""When I look back now I realise what a great team they had,"" Wenger said of United. ""(Ryan) Giggs, (Paul) Scholes, as young players they had (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Wayne) Rooney and you see what Ronaldo and Rooney went on to do in the rest of their career.

""(Ruud) van Nistelrooy, all these players together -- it was an unbelievable team and I think I realise more with a bit of distance what a challenge it was.""



United are hoping to consolidate their hold on second place in the Premier League, which would mark a significant improvement over last year's sixth-placed finish for the club, who have also qualified for the FA Cup final, where they will face Chelsea.

Arsene Wenger hopes for a peaceful end to his decade-and-a-half long war of words with Jose Mourinho even if he somewhat declined the olive branch of friendship offered his way earlier this week by the Manchester United boss.

Wenger takes his Arsenal team to Old Trafford for the final time on Sunday and whilst the stakes have rarely been so low - the Gunners’ priority is unquestionably the second leg of their Europa League semi-final with Atletico Madrid on Thursday - there is always the prospect of fireworks when the Frenchman and Mourinho come head-to-head.

Since Mourinho’s arrival at Chelsea in 2004 the two have rarely indicated they share much beyond an enmity for each other. The United boss has previously described Wenger as a “specialist in failure” and a “voyeur”, whilst the Arsenal manager’s jibes have included labelling his opposite number “stupid”.

Mourinho admitted earlier this week that he regretted some of those comments and expressed his desire to build bridges before Wenger leaves Arsenal at the end of the season, saying: ""If he respects me even 50 per cent of what I respect him we can even be friends in the future.”

Asked whether he could envisage a friendship blossoming between him and Mourinho, Wenger joked: “It depends.

“I respect him of course. I don’t want to go into individuals.

“You should give me a little bit of piece for my final weeks and not try to push me into a final confrontation.

“I want to go peaceful and with Mourinho as well, because he’s a great manager.”

Wenger has made plain his desire to remain in club management after his Arsenal reign ends and offered what could be interpreted as a warning to his great rival.

“I say goodbye to everybody you know,” he said. “In France we say au revoir.

“That means you might see me again.”

As was the case with the thawing of his relationship with Mourinho’s predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson, Mourinho’s willingness to make amends speaks to the fact that Arsenal, 17 points behind them, do not currently constitute a serious threat.

That might also mean that the Old Trafford crowd are willing to bury the hatchet and offer a warm farewell to the man who beat them to the title on their own turf in 2002.

“I always got a very good reception,” he said, tongue firmly in cheek. “I’ll be focused on winning the game. We had some great battles in 22 years.

“Manchester United is a massive club with fantastic players. You only realise today when you look back how great their team was.

""When you think they had [Ryan] Giggs, [Paul] Scholes, [David] Beckham and after [Cristiano] Ronaldo and [Wayne] Rooney together at a young age. When you see what they did later it shows you the challenge was absolutely huge. Van Nistelrooy, all those players together, they had an unbelievable team.

""I realise that better with the distance than at the time.”",sport,https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-seeking-peaceful-end-to-15year-feud-with-manchester-united-manager-jose-mourinho-a3825911.html

"Outgoing Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger lamented a familiar defensive lapse as his side failed to cash in on a man advantage for over 80 minutes in a 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday. Antoine Griezmann's away goal eight minutes from time is a body blow to Wenger's hopes of bowing out after 22 years on a high in the final on May 16, and Arsenal's chances of playing Champions League football next season. Sime Vrsaljko's early red card handed Arsenal the initiative, however, they were made to rue a host of missed chances before and after Alexandre Lacazette headed them in front on the hour mark.

""I feel we produced the performance we wanted to produce, but the result is not in line with the performance,"" said Wenger.

""We can only look at ourselves for tonight's result because 1-0 is a perfect result at home. It was up to us not to make a mistake...it is a story we have seen before.""

Atletico coach Diego Simeone was also sent to the stands shortly after Vrsaljko's dismissal, but the Spaniards resisted manfully and Simeone hailed their resistence.

""You don't have any idea how hard it is to defend and defend and defend,"" said Simeone. ""You have to have huge balls to defend for more than 80 minutes like that.

""These players of Atletico Madrid are heroes to resist like that.""

Arsenal now need to become the first away team to score in 12 matches at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano stadium next week to progress, and Simeone urged the home support to create an explosive atmosphere.

""Next week the stadium has to explode with positive energy,"" added the Argentine.

""We can play well or badly but you don't see this commitment everywhere...I have goosebumps thinking about next week already.""

There was a highly-charged atmosphere for Wenger's penultimate home game in charge and the hosts were given plenty of encouragement early on, even when still up against Atletico's full complement.

Lacazette volleyed off the outside of the post and forced Jan Oblak into the first of a series of fine saves with a header from close range.

Simeone sent-off

Vrsaljko had been booked within two minutes for bringing down Jack Wilshere.

And the Croatian left his side a man light after just 10 minutes when French referee Clement Turpin showed no leniency for another late challenge on Lacazette.

Moments later, Simeone was also dismissed by the officious referee for taking his protests too far when an Arsenal player wasn't booked for what he thought was a similar foul.

Atletico's excellent defensive record is what has carried them to five European semi-finals in seven seasons under Simeone.

The visitors battened down the hatches with 10 men, but were reliant on Oblak, who Wenger described as ""one of the best goalkeepers in the world"", to keep them in the tie.

""Of course you come out tonight with a bitter taste because we had the chances to be in the final tonight,"" added Wenger.

""The regret is we were not clinical enough.""

Atletico retreated ever deeper towards their own goal after the break and were finally punished on the hour mark when Wilshere's deep cross found Lacazette rising above Lucas Hernandez to head in his seventh goal in seven games.

Arsenal could and should have added to their lead, but instead some comical defending cost them dearly when Atletico grabbed a vital away goal.

Griezmann outmuscled French international team-mate Laurent Koscielny and then benefited from a slip by Shkodran Mustafi after his initial effort had been saved by David Ospina to prod his 27th goal of the season into the roof of the net.

There was still time for Oblak to show why Griezmann isn't the only Atletico player wanted by Europe's elite with a spectacular one-handed save to turn Aaron Ramsey's header behind and keep Los Rojiblancos on course for a third European final in five seasons.",sport,https://sports.ndtv.com/football/europa-league-profligate-arsenal-punished-by-10-man-atletico-madrid-1843604

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Since last week's announcement that Arsene Wenger would be stepping down after 22 years as manager of Arsenal Football Club, there has been much gossip, speculation and conjecture centering on who might succeed the 68-year-old.

Wenger's departure comes with Arsenal having recently added several new backroom staff members who will be key to appointing Frenchman's successor. But who might they pick? Xinhua takes a look at the likely runners and riders.

Carlo Ancelotti

The Italian boasts a proven track record of success, with league championships wins in four different countries, as well as three Champions League titles. Ancelotti also has Premier League experience, having had a two-year spell in charge of local rivals Chelsea, and is currently available after leaving German champions Bayern Munich earlier this year. But while the Ancelotti name would certainly help attract top talent to the Emirates, at 58 he is hardly a long-term option, and also remains a leading candidate for the Italian national team, a post which may prove difficult for him to turn down.

Luis Enrique

Also currently a free agent, Enrique has stated his desire to work in English football and is rumored to be the preferred choice of Arsenal's new Head of Football Relations Raul Sanllehi, with whom the Spaniard worked at Barcelona. However, despite winning a hatful of trophies with the Catalan giants, there remain unanswered questions over Enrique's ultimate managerial ability, and he was accused of tactical inflexibility during his last season at Barcelona. Previous spells at Celta Vigo and Roma were also underwhelming, and it remains to be seen how successful a boss Enrique would be without some of the world's best players at his disposal.

Joachim Loew

The German has been at the helm of his country's national team since 2006, during which he has gained a reputation for attacking and incisive football that saw Germany lift the 2014 FIFA World Cup. But despite his considerable success internationally, Loew has not managed at club level since 2004, and his lack of recent experience or accomplishment in the domestic game may count against him. The German would also be unlikely to leave his current post until after this summer's World Cup, and with the Premier League season starting just one month later, that would leave precious little time for pre-season preparation and player recruitment.

Max Allegri

Another Italian, Allegri's all-conquering Juventus side has won the last three Serie A and Coppa Italia titles. The Italian is rumored to be keen on testing himself in the Premier League, and has notably been taking English lessons over the past couple of years. Known for his tactical flexibility and an ability to successfully adapt his teams to suit different sets of players and circumstances, Allegri has also been linked with a likely vacancy at Chelsea, and it may be that the Italian will find himself managing in London soon, one way or another.

Mikel Arteta

A former Arsenal captain, the Spaniard remains a fan favorite at the Emirates, and since hanging up his boots in 2016 has been learning his trade as assistant manager to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. Arteta has been highly praised for his work at the Etihad, and would be a popular choice to take over from Wenger, who signed him as a player in 2011. However, with no managerial experience, it would be asking an awful lot of the Spaniard to take the reigns at Arsenal this summer. Perhaps one for the future instead.

Diego Simeone

In many ways the complete antithesis of Wenger's managerial style, Simeone's teams are well-drilled and notoriously difficult to beat, traits which have seen his Atletico Madrid side punch well above their weight in recent years to compete as equals with Barcelona and city neighbors Real. The Argentinian has enjoyed a special bond with players and fans at Atletico, but with many of his current charges starting to come to the end of their careers, he may feel that the time is now right to move on. Simeone would doubtless seek to tighten up an Arsenal defense which has proved porous in recent years. The question is whether the current crop of players would be able to adapt effectively to Simeone's pragmatic quasi-catenaccio after they have been schooled in a much more expansive style of play.

And the rest...

Germany's Thomas Tuchel has a reputation as one of the most promising young coaches in the game, though he is thought to be taking over at Paris Saint-Germain. Former Arsenal favorites Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry both remain popular figures at the Emirates, but lack relevant management experience. Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers has distanced himself from the role, while highly-rated Hoffenheim manager Julian Nagelsmann is considered too young. And while Rafa Benitez, Lucien Favre, Eddie Howe and Leonardo Jardim have all proved themselves capable of doing a good job on a budget in recent seasons, none are thought to be in serious contention.",sport,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/26/c_137138790.htm
"Arsene Wenger has claimed that he wants a ""peaceful"" ending tomorrow to one of the Premier League's most intense feuds when he goes up against Jose Mourinho for the last time as Arsenal manager.

Arsene Wenger has claimed that he wants a ""peaceful"" ending tomorrow to one of the Premier League's most intense feuds when he goes up against Jose Mourinho for the last time as Arsenal manager.

Their rivalry has spanned three managerial jobs for Mourinho but the lingering presence of Wenger - and the plaudits he has received - has seemed always to irritate the Manchester United manager and there have been spectacular verbal clashes.

It even got physical at Stamford Bridge four years ago when Wenger shoved Mourinho, but the Portuguese delivered an unexpectedly warm tribute following the news that Wenger was leaving Arsenal. ""If he respects me even 50pc of what I respect him, we can even be friends in the future,"" he said.

Wenger looked bemused when asked yesterday if he could be friends with Mourinho, eventually saying ""it depends"", but was also far more willing than usual to praise his rival's achievements. ""I respect him a lot,"" said Wenger. ""You should give me a little bit of peace for my final weeks, don't push me into a final confrontation. I want to go peacefully. Mourinho is a great manager.""

Few stadiums have been more significant to Wenger than Old Trafford. He led Arsenal to the double there in 2002 but it was also the stage for the 'Battle of the Buffet' in 2004 when he and Alex Ferguson were part of a bust-up.

""If I get a good reception, I will take it,"" said Wenger. ""There have been some great battles. Man United is a massive club with fantastic players. When I go back, I realise what a great team they were."" Wenger again confirmed that he turned down the opportunity to manage United after meeting Martin Edwards, the then chairman, ahead of Ferguson's first planned retirement in 2002.

""I've turned many, many clubs down,"" he added.

He also said that Henrikh Mkhitaryan could return against his former club ahead of Arsenal's Europa League semi-final second leg with Atletico Madrid on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Mourinho has admitted he harbours regrets about his past treatment of Wenger. Mourinho, who maintained yesterday that United would not sell goalkeeper David de Gea to Real Madrid this summer, and Wenger have endured one of the stormiest relationships of any rival Premier League managers. The United manager described Wenger as ""a specialist in failure"" during his second spell in charge of Chelsea.

Mourinho also branded Wenger a ""voyeur"" after accusing the Frenchman of being obsessed with Chelsea, to which Wenger responded by calling his counterpart ""out of order, disconnected with reality and disrespectful"".

Their verbal warfare almost spilt over into fisticuffs in 2014 when Wenger and Mourinho clashed during Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. But Mourinho has sought a belated rapprochement with Wenger and encouraged United fans, who have directed many ugly chants at Wenger in the past owing to his fierce rivalry with Ferguson, to show the Arsenal manager respect. ""When I arrived in England in 2004, Arsenal was the champion and was the famous champion of Invincibles, and I arrive and for the next couple of years it was with them.

""(Dennis) Bergkamp, Thierry (Henry), (Sol) Campbell - amazing team, so, again, thank you very much for that. They pushed us to the limits."" Mourinho added: “The two matches we played at their amazing old stadium (Highbury) were unforgettable. “We had big matches, big fights, so thank you so much for that.

“Regret? Little negative episodes, yes I do, and probably he also does. “I always feel the biggest rivals are our biggest friends because they’re the ones that pushed us to the limit,” added Mourinho. “I think Manchester United fans know that until 2004, for about a decade, that was between Manchester United and Arsenal, between Sir Alex and Mr Wenger.

“I think that these great teams Arsenal had, and the fight shoulder to shoulder with Manchester United, made United better and better. “I hope he (Wenger) has a good reaction – if not good, not bad at all – and from us as a club he is going to feel the respect we have.” Alexis Sanchez will face Arsenal for the first time since quitting the club to join United in January.

The Chile striker has endured a difficult start but he scored in United’s 2-1 FA Cup semi-final win over Spurs last weekend and Mourinho believes fans will see a greatly improved player next term. “Next season after pre-season, after being comfortable and adapted, he’s going to be great for us,” Mourinho said. Real Madrid are again being linked with a summer move for star man De Gea but Mourinho said there was “no chance” of the Spain goalkeeper leaving Old Trafford this summer.

De Gea, who originally hails from the Spanish capital, came close to swapping Old Trafford for the Santiago Bernabeu in 2015, only for the transfer to collapse at the 11th hour. The Spain international subsequently signed a new four-year contract with United but that deal is due to expire at the end of next season and several high-profile errors by Keylor Navas have led to speculation of a revived bid. Meanwhile, Mourinho has insisted he deserves credit for bringing Mohamed Salah, who has scored 43 goals for Liverpool this season, to Stamford Bridge and that it was Chelsea that decided to sell the Egyptian after he was sacked.

"IPL 2018: 4 benched players who can change their teams' fortunes

These 4 benched cricketers should now be included in the playing XI.

Shuvaditya Bose ANALYST Top 5 / Top 10 28 Apr 2018, 01:23 IST 5.76K Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email

JP Duminy has not played a single match for MI in this season

After the completion of the IPL XI auctions, which took place earlier this year, every team looked formidable on paper. But cricket is played on a pitch and hence some teams that looked intimidating on paper have gone meek and the owners are receiving loads of questions.

Mumbai Indians, with all the big names like Rohit Sharma, Kieron Pollard and the Pandya brothers, have won just one game in six matches and are currently sitting below seven teams in the points table. After a decade of humiliation and severe trolling, Royal Challengers Bangalore's team finally looked good on paper. Kolkata Knight Riders spent every single penny that they had to get big names on their team.

But these aforementioned teams have not yet found their footing this season whereas teams like Sunrisers Hyderabad, who lack star-power, and Chennai Super Kings, filled with aged cricketers, are ruling the pack. But the teams currently having a dress circle seat in a pit full of ignominy can turn things around if they give a chance to these benched cricketers.

#4 Ben Cutting (Mumbai Indians)

Ben Cutting has played one game in MI colours

The points table clearly states that Mumbai Indians have won just one out of their six matches, but what it does not is the fact that they need to win at least seven out of their remaining eight games to make it to the playoffs. They are very much in a make or break situation and if this is not the right time to bench Kieron Pollard then there is not any.

The giant from Trinidad has scored just 63 runs in 6 games at an average of around 15 and is yet to bowl. Mumbai are in dire need of an all-rounder and they have one in Australian Ben Cutting. 'Cuttsy', as he is called by his teammates, has played just one game and did not make much of a contribution. But his IPL career average is over 22 and strike rate is over 175. Moreover, with an economy rate of under 9 runs per over and 7 wickets to his name, he can be an efficacious bowler.",sport,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/ipl-2018-4-benched-players-who-can-change-their-teams-fortunes

"Captain Cool he is. The morning after MS Dhoni blasted an unbeaten 70 off just 34 balls to take his IPL team to a resounding victory, he was found devoted to a much less testosterone heavy activity: gently and very meticulously wielding the hair dryer on his daughter Ziva’s cute little head. Like many celebrity children today she has a significant fan following of her own. But their father-daughter moments have a special weight – and charm.

Nordic countries have shown the world the daddy dividend is real. In Finland fathers now spend reportedly more time with school-aged children than mothers. In Norway a study finds that daughters in particular flourish if their dads too take time off for their birth. Daddy time helps build gender equal societies. It’s healthy for the children and of course very rewarding for the fathers too!

In strictly gender segregated households where man brings in the money and woman rolls out the chapattis, she also does the bulk of parenting. Children then often ending up modelling their own behaviour as adults, on what the partnership between their father and mother looked like. This cycle can only be broken when children have fathers who are not emotionally distant authority figures, but nurturers, intimates, changing diapers and warming the milk bottles, watching Chhota Bheem or playing in the dollhouse with them, maybe teaching their son to cook or their daughter to play cricket.",sport,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/daddy-duties-his-daughters-hairdresser-is-ms-dhoni/

"Madrid: Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has paid tribute to Andres Iniesta after he said he was leaving Barcelona and believes the midfielder should have won the Ballon d'Or in 2010.

Iniesta announced on Friday he will be leaving Barca at the end of the season, bringing an end to a 22-year association with the club. He is expected to move to China but is yet to name his next team.

The 33-year-old has enjoyed a glittering career, winning eight La Liga and four Champions League titles, but has never claimed football's most prestigious individual award.

Iniesta was beaten to the Ballon d'Or by Lionel Messi in 2010, despite clinching the World Cup that year with Spain and scoring the decisive goal against Holland in the final.

""What I'm going to say will maybe make headlines tomorrow,"" Zidane said with a smile on Friday.

""I think he really deserved to win the Ballon d'Or when he won his World Cup, he had an exceptional year and he finished the World Cup by winning it, by scoring (in the final), so obviously that year he would have deserved it.""

It was the period when Iniesta was arguably at his best, as Barcelona won three consecutive league titles under Pep Guardiola, as well as the Champions League twice.

""I could spend a lot of minutes talking about him, he's another part of the history of Barca in the last 15 or 20 years which would not be possible without him,"" Guardiola said.

""I just want to say thank you because he helped me to understand the game better.

""Just watching him do what he does on the football pitch despite the amount of tackles, the way he's a professional... I thank him so much for what he has done.

""When he decides to retire, maybe a decade from now, he will come back into football - at Barcelona especially - and he can teach others what he's shown on the pitch.""

Iniesta is expected to announce his international retirement after this summer's World Cup when he will be hoping to go out on a high by winning the tournament again with Spain.

Spain coach Julen Lopetegui has no doubt about Iniesta's motivation in Russia.

""Andres is a player absolutely in the first class,"" Lopetegui said.

""I would not speak of Andres in the past, I speak of him in the present. The recognition he has had at all levels of international football is not earned by chance.

""How he has won and how he has behaved in victory makes him loved in all the stadiums in Spain and abroad, and that is a treasure very few players in history can have.

"Iniesta the perfect poster boy for a new generation of talents at Barca

22:00 Share Close

The midfielder announced his decision to quit Camp Nou on Friday, but called for the Blaugrana to put their faith in La Masia

Andres Iniesta really is leaving Barcelona. The news that all of the club's fans did not want to hear became reality on Friday as the player confirmed his departure in a tearful press conference.

The start of a long and painful goodbye had started last Saturday. In the final of the Copa del Rey, Iniesta signed off with a goal and a vintage display, before leaving the pitch to an ovation from fans of both Barca and Sevilla.

On the way off, he had embraced several of his team-mates and he then sat on the bench for a few minutes, emotion etched on his face as tears flowed down his cheeks. And shortly afterwards, he returned to lift the trophy following a comprehensive 5-0 win.

After the game, he refused to confirm his departure, but said he would speak soon, and after the whole squad were given most of the week off, Friday was the time to announce his decision to the world.

Flanked by family, friends, the Barca board and most of his team-mates (Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi, the latter due to a passport issue, were notable absentees), the 33-year-old revealed his reasons for walking away.

""I don't want to fool myself or fool anybody,"" he said. ""I'm 34 years old (actually he is not 34 until next month) and I know that everything would be more difficult. It's a rule of life. Other challenges come and I will try to be as happy as I have been here.""

Clearly, it was a difficult decision. ""It is a really hard day for me,"" he said of his imminent exit and move to China. ""Because I have been here my whole life. Saying goodbye to what has been my home and my life is really complicated. But I understand that what comes next is even more complicated and difficult.

""I could never forgive myself for making an uncomfortable situation at a club that has given me everything. That would not be fair on me and it would not be fair on the club.""

Iniesta had signed a ""lifetime"" contract at Barca in October, but he had doubts back then and has chosen to leave on a high, still performing at the top level and with a domestic double set to be sealed this weekend as the Catalans close in on La Liga.

The player broke down several times on Friday and especially as he thanked his parents and his sister, also present, remembering how he had arrived a shy kid 22 years ago, and his wife and ""three treasures"", who were also in the room to watch his farewell press conference.

There was also a message for the club. ""Succeeding here was ingrained in my head,"" he said. ""It was a bit tough at first but it didn't matter. The club should be aware of the value of the youth system. They are working well.""

""Andres eats at a different table,"" Guardiola once said early on in his tenure as Barca boss. ""He's an example. I always says he's an example for the youth players. They should look at him: he doesn't wear ear rings, he doesn't dye his hair.

""He plays 20 minutes and he doesn't complain. Wherever you play him, he doesn't complain. And he always plays well, and he always trains well. And when he is injured, he is in a bad mood because he wants to come back and help the team. For Barca to have a player like him is priceless.""

It has been and without Andres, nothing will be quite the same again. But Guardiola is right: just as Pep himself was back in the day, Iniesta is the perfect poster boy for a new generation of talents at La Masia. He can only hope the club gives them a chance.",sport,http://www.goal.com/en-in/news/iniesta-the-perfect-poster-boy-for-a-new-generation-of/14xcy1sn96vb810yoqdgk7ledn
"Barcelona’s Andres Iniesta during Champions League fixture against Chelsea. (Reuters) Barcelona’s Andres Iniesta during Champions League fixture against Chelsea. (Reuters)

Barcelona’s departing captain Andres Iniesta was hailed as a “real football man” by Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane after the Spain international announced he is leaving the La Liga club after 16 years at the heart of the team’s midfield.

“It’s difficult for me and for anyone who likes football. I don’t see him as a Barcelona player but a football man,” Zidane told a news conference on Friday.

“He is charming, very reserved and I like people like that. I don’t know him well but I only have good words for him and I wish him all the best as a player and as a person.”

Spain coach Julen Lopetegui said Iniesta was still one of the best players around and added not many footballers receive the adoration that the Barca veteran does.

The midfielder was given a standing ovation by both sets of supporters in last week’s King’s Cup final against Sevilla in which he delivered a virtuoso display and scored in Barca’s 5-0 win.

“He is a player who first of all is still at the top of his game. He has been a regular starter for us in every game and I don’t speak about him in the past but in the present,” Lopetegui told reporters.

“Obviously the path that he has had and the recognition he has received on an international level is no coincidence, he has earned it for everything he has achieved and for his personality.”

Iniesta is one of the most loved footballers in Spain after he scored the only goal in the 2010 World Cup final when they beat the Netherlands to lift the trophy for the first time.

He also played a key role in Spain winning the 2008 European Championship to snap a 44-year trophy drought and he was named player of the tournament when they defended the title in 2012.

He is set to retire from international football after the World Cup in Russia.

“The manner in which he has won everything and his behaviour after winning has meant that he is given standing ovations in stadiums across Spain and abroad,” added Lopetegui.

“That is something which very few other footballers in history have had.”

"Andres Iniesta was brought to tears as he announced he will be leaving Barcelona at the end of the season after 22 years with the club. (1:11)

Desperate, the coach called one of his substitutes over and pointed toward the pitch at a small, pale kid in midfield, a year younger than everyone else out there, who was tearing his team apart. ""See him?"" he said. ""Stop him.""

It was a regional game at the U15 level, the Catalan representative side had scored four or five already, and the substitute from another part of Spain -- big, powerful and by his own admission a little wild, as desperate as the man sending him on -- didn't need telling twice. He also took the instruction too literally, running onto the pitch and kicking his opponent. Hard. ""You've got two days left in football,"" he said, trying to look as tough as he could.

Luckily for everyone, for football, he was wrong.

That was almost 20 years ago now, and. no, you're not about to find out the name of the player who did it (although he's mighty happy he was wrong) but as you've probably guessed, the name of the kid he kicked was Andres Iniesta Lujan, winner of 35 titles (more than one for every year of his life) starting with a league in 2005 and almost certainly ending with another, his ninth, on Sunday night in La Coruna. There have also been six Copas, the most recent surely to be known as ""The Iniesta Final,"" plus four Champions Leagues, two European Championships and the World Cup.

The 116th minute of the final in 2010 will always be his moment; that moment when he said he heard the silence in Johannesburg and so, 4,915 miles away in Fuentealbilla, his tiny Spanish hometown of 2,701, did his father Jose Antonio, until Mari broke it.

When the goal went in, everyone in the Bar Lujan, run by Iniesta's granddad, erupted. At first, Iniesta's mum, Mari, didn't realise it was her son who had scored, but when they told her she set off running home to where Jose Antonio sat alone in the living room. Unable to take the nerves, he had turned the telly off. ""Jose Antonio,"" she shouted, ""our little boy has scored! He scored! Andres!""

""What? When? How long is left?""

""I don't know. All I know is that Andres scored!""

On Friday afternoon, Mari and Jose Antonio sat in the room as Andres announced he is going at the end of the season. ""They brought me here by car 22 years ago and they're here now,"" Iniesta said. The club's president was there, too, and some of his teammates (plus the media, of course) to hear him say he was leaving Barcelona and Spain too. He didn't announce where he is going, but he did insist that he would never play against his club, so can't stay in Europe: Mari and Jose Antonio's little boy is heading to China.

He didn't have two days left back then, but he does have just five left now: Deportivo, Real Madrid, Levante, Sevilla and then Real Sociedad. Iniesta's last day at the Camp Nou will be May 20, 22 years after his first.

It's official now.

""Good afternoon,"" Iniesta said. There was a pause, and then another. And another. ""This press conference is to make public the decision,"" he said, ""that this season will be,"" he said, ""the last."" It was when he said ""last"" that his voice broke, for the first time, the word sticking in his throat. The delivery was slow. He gulped. Took a sip of water. Took a deep breath. Tried to carry on. Tears appeared in his eyes, soon escaping down his cheeks.

It was expected, an open secret for some time now, but that didn't make it easy. Nor did the conviction that it was the right decision, but he explained why he felt that way, an honesty and self-awareness in his words.

""I feel at peace with myself,"" he said.

Those around him have accepted the decision, of course -- ""Andres has earned the right to choose what he wants and when,"" is a phrase that's been repeated often recently -- which isn't to say everyone agreed. After last weekend's Copa del Rey final, one headline pleaded: ""Don't go, Iniesta!"" but Iniesta wants to go and he wants to go like this. He didn't want to linger, bid farewell from the bench or ever feel like he wasn't good enough any more. And he sensed that, two weeks from his 34th birthday, this moment might be close.

""If I had imagined a way of ending my spell here, it would have been like this,"" he said. ""Feeling useful, a starter, with the chance of winning titles and with the positive feelings I have had all year.""

""It's a very difficult day for me because I have spent my whole life here and saying goodbye to my home is hard. But I understand that this is nature, life, natural law. What lies ahead is difficult. I would not allow myself to go through an uncomfortable situation at the club that has given me everything. I wouldn't deserve that and nor would the club. I would never feel happy if I didn't give the club my best.""

Soon, Iniesta knew (or thought he knew) he would not be able to do that. For more than a decade he has. ""My only objective was to succeed here,"" he said. ""And I have.""

It went beyond that, of course. A little earlier, barely 10 minutes before Iniesta appeared, Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane had been asked about him some 450 miles away. ""He's a Barcelona player, but I don't think of him like that,"" Zidane said. ""I think of him as football's.""

Transcending teams, Iniesta was everyone's, held close for the way he is as well as the way he plays. ""I hope I am remembered as a good player and a good person,"" he said. It didn't sound like the platitude it might have from others, nor did it sound so implausible. On Thursday night, one former teammate talked of his sadness at the way football really is, the way people are. Andres, he said, was an exception. Others would agree.

Pep Guardiola once said: ""Andres doesn't dye his hair, doesn't wear earrings and hasn't got any tattoos. That makes him unattractive to the media, but he's the best,"" while Lorenzo Serra Ferrer, the coach who first called him up to train with the senior side, lamented ""sadly, a humble, discreet footballer doesn't sell like one who's loud.""

And yet, if that meant people were slow to appreciate him, eventually it made him even more popular, not least because it was no pose or act. Failing to stand out made him stand out, his ""normality"" somehow considered abnormal. Zidane said he had not spent much time with Iniesta but that when he had he found him encantador. It doesn't mean charming, not really; it's more like ""nice."" ""He's reserved, and then he shows it on the pitch,"" Zidane said. ""I like that.""

""I admire him,"" Zidane continued. ""I admire the way he plays."" They all do.

""If he had been called 'Andresinho,' he would have won the Ballon d'Or,"" Sergio Ramos said on Wednesday night in Munich. What he said probably wasn't true, but the sentiment that led him to say it was. The fact that he said it where he said it and when it said it was significant, too. Two days later, when it was official, others said similar things. France Football even apologised for the fact that Iniesta had never won their award. Messages flooded Friday from players at every club, with gratitude and appreciation in every one.

It is not just what he won; it is how he won. In his book ""The Artist"" -- a book in which he preferred that others talk over doing so himself -- the testimonies are glowing, the stories a record of a boy who always played differently. (Editor's note: Sid Lowe was the translator and editor of the English language edition.)

""After five minutes we said: 'take that little kid off, we've seen enough,'"" remembered the coach who was at his trial at Albacete, Spain. Guardiola was Iniesta's idol, his poster pinned on the wall by the bunk alongside others of Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Laudrup. When Iniesta was 15, Guardiola signed a photograph for him, dedicating it to ""the best player I've ever seen.""

On Friday, Guardiola offered his thanks. Players supposedly learn from coaches, he said, but not in his case: he learned from Iniesta. ""I could say a lot of things, but basically [what sticks with me is] the pleasure of seeing him train, how everything was easy, I think the most impressive thing about him is how naturally he played: That is very difficult to find in a football player.""

Burak Akbulut/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images

It is the simplicity of it all, which is sometimes the most difficult thing of all. ""Just a single control of Andres's ..."" Ernesto Valverde said last Saturday, pausing to add, ""... I'd have given an arm to have been able to do that when I played.""

It's like Iniesta connects you to something more elemental. ""What I do in the stadium, I did on the school playground,"" he has said. That helps take him beyond titles, though no one in Spain has won more, and beyond goals or the assists, though he did score the most important Spanish goal ever. It's not about stats; it's about sensations, the way that he seems to glide as if he occupies some other place, almost trance-like, untouchable, however many people are around him. There is even a website dedicated to Iniesta that is just photos of him, surrounded by opponents -- three, four, five or even six of them, yet they're still somehow unable to take the ball off him.

There is a reason for that, one coach says, even if Iniesta is not conscious of it.

""Iniesta holds the ball so long, inviting pressure on himself and taking responsibility because, somewhere deep down, he knows that he is better than them,"" he says. Some create space by moving away from the ball; Iniesta creates space by moving others towards it. Then, when the moment is right, he's suddenly gone, wriggling free. Or the ball is passed on. ""My teammates would have an easier life if I always had five men on me,"" he said, saying much.

That's real bravery. That's taking risks, and football is richer for it. In a way, Iniesta rebelled, maybe even helped lead a revolution. Silently, of course, but a revolution nonetheless.

Iniesta vindicated a certain type of player, a style, an idea; he embodied something else, elevating not just Barcelona and Spain but the game, changing the culture, championing inspiration over intimidation. Go back to that match at the start of his career: they tried to stop Iniesta that day, just as they have tried many times since, but they couldn't. He didn't have two days left; he had many, many more, and they were the best days of his life. The best days of theirs, too.",sport,http://www.espn.com/soccer/club/barcelona/83/blog/post/3473770/andres-iniesta-leaving-barcelona-on-his-terms-championed-bravery-over-bravado

New Delhi: The Committee of Administrators (CoA) came down heavily on Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) for trying to conduct fresh election on the basis of a new constitution which is non-compliant.

Maharashtra CA secretary Riyaz Bagwan had sent circulars to all district units stating that elections would be conducted on May 2 as per the newly amended constitution conforming to Lodha Committee recommendations.

However, CoA after scrutiny of the new constitution found out a lot of anomalies and pointed it out in a two-page letter making it clear that in case elections are held, it would be declared ""null and void"".

""The elections proposed to be held on 2nd May 2018 are contrary to the directives issued by the Hon'ble Justice Lodha Committee in exercise of the powers conferred on it vide the Judgment since the Amended Constitution is not compliant with the Judgment,"" COA wrote in its letter.

""The Committee of Administrators and the BCCI will treat the MCA as a defaulting State Association and shall not recognize the results of such elections and treat the same as null and void,"" the Vinod Rai-led committee made it clear.

"DELHI, India – Andre Russell and Sunil Narine sparkled, albeit briefly, but their efforts were not enough as Kolkata Knight Riders crumbled under the pressure of a difficult run chase and tumbled to a 55-run loss in the Indian Premier League, Friday.

Chasing 220 – the highest total in the tournament this season – at the Feroz Shah Kotla, KKR could only muster 164 for nine from their 20 overs, as they slipped to their fourth defeat of the season.

Russell top-scored with 44 from 30 balls, Shubman Gill struck 37 while Narine blasted a spectacular nine-ball 26 at the top of the order.

The left-handed Narine attacked from the outset, striking a four and three sixes but KKR were still in trouble at 33 for three when he fell at the end of the third over.

Narine had blasted two consecutive sixes down the ground off left-arm seamer Trent Boult (2-44) when he tried to clear point off the final delivery but succeeded only in picking out cover.

Two more wickets fell to leave KKR tottering on 77 for five but Russell arrived to add 64 for the sixth wicket with Gill, in a failed rescue mission.

The right-hander belted three fours and four sixes – including two in the 12th over from Avesh Khan which leaked 15 runs – while Gill counted three fours and a six.

Gill’s run out in the 16th over broke the stand and Russell followed two overs later, yorked by Avesh with victory already out of the question for KKR. (CMC)",sport,http://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/152169/russell-narine-cameos-fail-save-kkr

"A decade ago, the luminaries of cricket writing sat in the press box at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru, with very little idea of what to expect. They had come from England and Australia and all over India to witness what Lalit Modi, the founder of the Indian Premier League (IPL), promised would be the biggest show on turf. A man whose confidence matched his capacity for hyperbole, Modi asserted that the IPL would soon outstrip the Premier League and La Liga in terms of popularity.

On a night that combined stilt-walkers, acrobats, a laser show, cheerleaders from the Washington Redskins and a heavy dose of Bollywood, most of us left the venue in a daze, unsure of whether we’d had a glimpse of a brave new world, or a slightly tacky burlesque. There was some cricket too, with Brendon McCullum’s six-filled 158 for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) inspiring a thrashing of the Royal Challengers (RCB) at home.

Those were fractious times for the sport. Monkeygate and its aftermath hung in the air, as did the jealousy and resentment caused by the first IPL auction, where some of cricket’s thoroughbreds had fetched less money than some of its journeymen. The heroes of an Indian team about to embark on its ascent to the top of the rankings had been divvied up across the franchises.

Sachin Tendulkar was in Mumbai, Rahul Dravid in Bengaluru. Sourav Ganguly led Shah Rukh Khan’s Knights in Kolkata, while V.V.S. Laxman captained the Deccan Chargers. Virender Sehwag was the face of the Delhi franchise, while Yuvraj Singh was expected to get the crowds to do bhangra in Mohali. Chennai Super Kings opted for the leadership of M.S. Dhoni, and only Rajasthan Royals bucked the trend by reposing faith in the charisma of the retired Shane Warne.

Even as we struggled to get our heads around the idea of franchises, traditional rivalries dominated storylines. Chennai vs Mumbai became one of the key games to watch because it featured Matthew Hayden and Harbhajan Singh, whom Hayden had called an “obnoxious little weed” just months earlier.

Singh’s season didn’t last long after he slapped S. Sreesanth at the end of a game in Mohali. But even with him gone, Sreesanth couldn’t escape scrutiny. Hayden laid into him at a press conference, calling him a singularly ordinary cricketer.

It wasn’t just their peers that the cricketers were getting stick from. Team owners expected immediate returns on investments and the teams that were struggling soon got to know that the million-dollar contracts came at a cost. Vijay Mallya was especially vocal in his criticism of his RCB squad, derided by most as a “Test team”. Towards the end of the season, a feted Indian international cricketer told me that he had never been spoken to with such lack of courtesy and respect.

There were other fault lines too. With seven Indian players needed in the playing XI, there simply wasn’t enough quality to go around. Rajasthan unearthed a couple of relatively unknown gems in Swapnil Asnodkar and Siddharth Trivedi, but, by and large, domestic players struggled horribly. Even those good enough to play for years for their states were no match for the game’s elite.

Shivam Mavi (second from left) celebrates after dismissing Delhi Daredevils’ Gautam Gambhir in Kolkata.

There was also the heat. Late April and May had always been off-season for Indian cricket. Now, with daytime temperatures in the high 30s or even 40s, the IPL became as much an exercise in endurance as a test of skill. The endless merry-go-round of matches, flights and practice was interspersed with plenty of after-parties and sponsors’ appearances. The so-called rest days were usually anything but.

The younger players—several members of Virat Kohli’s Under-19 World Cup-winning side had been drafted that year– looked dazed by it all, while the older ones squirmed about being removed from their usual match routines. But across the country, the crowds lapped it up. Chennai quickly whipped up an unmatched atmosphere, with Sivamani’s drumbeats providing the backdrop. Mumbai Indians’ games meant the familiar and comforting chants of “Sachin, Sachin!”, and Kolkata was unsure of whether to serenade Shah Rukh Khan or Sourav Ganguly.

Jaipur, despite the near-crippling heat, had a carnival atmosphere as their team, the underdogs, stormed to the top of the table. And no matter where the games were played, Modi was present on the sidelines, shaking hands and flashing smiles while surveying his kingdom in an immaculate linen suit.

In those days when temporary seating wasn’t frowned upon, as many as 3.4 million fans watched the IPL live at the stadiums, an average of 58,000. It was an astonishing endorsement, and emphatic proof that the IPL was here to stay.

Ten years on, as I set off on a journey that covered six venues in a week, the landscape was very different. And yet there was a sameness to it. This time, it was Sandpapergate and not Monkeygate that had plunged world cricket into crisis. Overnight, the Australian cricketers Steve Smith and David Warner had been brushed out of promotional billboards and adverts in Jaipur and Hyderabad. Instead of the India-Australia rivalry, it was the strained relationship between South Africans and Australians that was under scrutiny. And once again, Indians are captaining all but one team.

This time, barely anyone paid any attention to the opening ceremony, just as they no longer gawked at the cheerleaders. Shah Rukh Khan still elicited mild hysteria, but most of the punters weren’t there for a slice of glamour. They’re out there in intense summer heat because they want to see the best the game has to offer. The casual fan has largely come and gone. The ones that remain are there because they’ve bought into the franchise model and got behind “their” team.

The best players in the world still make a beeline for the IPL. What has changed is the layer below them. The hard-working-but-outclassed Indian pro is a thing of the past. Instead of the journeymen trundlers of 2008, you have thrilling talents such as Shivam Mavi, nudging the speed-gun towards 145 kmph. You have men like Sanju Samson and Nitish Rana holding their own against—and even eclipsing—the greatest names in the sport.

Then, you have promising spinners like Mayank Markande who have experienced commentators jumping out of their seats with excitement. When Nasser Hussain spoke of India having enough talent to fill two sides, he wasn’t just playing to the vast TV gallery. He was stating a fact. Ravichandran Ashwin has reinvented himself as a white-ball bowler in recent months, bowling leg-spin with elan, but still finds himself behind the likes of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav in the race for the India cap.

The crowds may not be comparable to the throngs of 2008, but they’re still sizeable. The “Sachin, Sachin” chants in Mumbai have given way to a sense of pride in a team that has won the title a record three times. Bangalore’s slow-and-steady approach gave way to the pyrotechnics of Messrs Kohli and A.B. de Villiers, while Hyderabad banks on the best bowling attack. Sehwag has moved further north to Mohali and formed what could be an exciting association with another original, Ashwin, while Warne mans the Jaipur dugout as a mentor.

Dhoni remains the king of Chennai hearts, but it was Kolkata that offered the greatest proof of the league having grown up. On the second Monday, Gautam Gambhir—who captained the Knight Riders for seven years and transformed them from the butt of all jokes to two-time champions—went back to Eden Gardens in Delhi Daredevils’ livery. The crowd was respectful, even appreciative of him, but there were no mixed loyalties at all. If anything, the volume was even higher as the team, now led by Dinesh Karthik, romped to an emphatic victory.

The after-hours high jinks are now largely a thing of the past. It’s not that the players don’t let their hair, or dreads, down from time to time, but these days, they are more likely to share videos of gym sessions. That’s the other huge change the IPL has seen since 2008. Then, there were more than a few players who weren’t exactly svelte. Now, almost everyone has washboard abs and the arms of a lumberjack, tattooed sleeves and all.

Andre Russell, the format’s most dominant performer—Dre Russ, to use his cool moniker—muscles 100m sixes, takes wickets while bowling with genuine pace, and can take mind-bending catches. He hasn’t played for the West Indies in two years. The size of the IPL cheque means that you no longer need to aspire to the national cap to cash in. Ten years ago, such a scenario was unthinkable. And while those from other countries try to analyse the impact of IPL on their cricket ecosystems, Indian cricket is immeasurably stronger thanks to the IPL, and a dream that became reality.",sport,https://www.livemint.com/Sports/CnO8bfn9Cn413aKFeAuRTL/IPL-then-and-now.html

Mumbai Indians’ games meant the familiar and comforting chants of “Sachin, Sachin!”, and Kolkata was unsure of whether to serenade Shah Rukh Khan or Sourav Ganguly.

Jaipur, despite the near-crippling heat, had a carnival atmosphere as their team, the underdogs, stormed to the top of the table. And no matter where the games were played, Modi was present on the sidelines, shaking hands and flashing smiles while surveying his kingdom in an immaculate linen suit.

In those days when temporary seating wasn’t frowned upon, as many as 3.4 million fans watched the IPL live at the stadiums, an average of 58,000. It was an astonishing endorsement, and emphatic proof that the IPL was here to stay.

Ten years on, as I set off on a journey that covered six venues in a week, the landscape was very different. And yet there was a sameness to it. This time, it was Sandpapergate and not Monkeygate that had plunged world cricket into crisis. Overnight, the Australian cricketers Steve Smith and David Warner had been brushed out of promotional billboards and adverts in Jaipur and Hyderabad. Instead of the India-Australia rivalry, it was the strained relationship between South Africans and Australians that was under scrutiny. And once again, Indians are captaining all but one team.

This time, barely anyone paid any attention to the opening ceremony, just as they no longer gawked at the cheerleaders. Shah Rukh Khan still elicited mild hysteria, but most of the punters weren’t there for a slice of glamour. They’re out there in intense summer heat because they want to see the best the game has to offer. The casual fan has largely come and gone. The ones that remain are there because they’ve bought into the franchise model and got behind “their” team.

The best players in the world still make a beeline for the IPL. What has changed is the layer below them. The hard-working-but-outclassed Indian pro is a thing of the past. Instead of the journeymen trundlers of 2008, you have thrilling talents such as Shivam Mavi, nudging the speed-gun towards 145 kmph. You have men like Sanju Samson and Nitish Rana holding their own against—and even eclipsing—the greatest names in the sport.

Then, you have promising spinners like Mayank Markande who have experienced commentators jumping out of their seats with excitement. When Nasser Hussain spoke of India having enough talent to fill two sides, he wasn’t just playing to the vast TV gallery. He was stating a fact. Ravichandran Ashwin has reinvented himself as a white-ball bowler in recent months, bowling leg-spin with elan, but still finds himself behind the likes of Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav in the race for the India cap.

The crowds may not be comparable to the throngs of 2008, but they’re still sizeable. The “Sachin, Sachin” chants in Mumbai have given way to a sense of pride in a team that has won the title a record three times. Bangalore’s slow-and-steady approach gave way to the pyrotechnics of Messrs Kohli and A.B. de Villiers, while Hyderabad banks on the best bowling attack. Sehwag has moved further north to Mohali and formed what could be an exciting association with another original, Ashwin, while Warne mans the Jaipur dugout as a mentor.

Dhoni remains the king of Chennai hearts, but it was Kolkata that offered the greatest proof of the league having grown up. On the second Monday, Gautam Gambhir—who captained the Knight Riders for seven years and transformed them from the butt of all jokes to two-time champions—went back to Eden Gardens in Delhi Daredevils’ livery. The crowd was respectful, even appreciative of him, but there were no mixed loyalties at all. If anything, the volume was even higher as the team, now led by Dinesh Karthik, romped to an emphatic victory.

The after-hours high jinks are now largely a thing of the past. It’s not that the players don’t let their hair, or dreads, down from time to time, but these days, they are more likely to share videos of gym sessions. That’s the other huge change the IPL has seen since 2008. Then, there were more than a few players who weren’t exactly svelte. Now, almost everyone has washboard abs and the arms of a lumberjack, tattooed sleeves and all.

Andre Russell, the format’s most dominant performer—Dre Russ, to use his cool moniker—muscles 100m sixes, takes wickets while bowling with genuine pace, and can take mind-bending catches. He hasn’t played for the West Indies in two years. The size of the IPL cheque means that you no longer need to aspire to the national cap to cash in. Ten years ago, such a scenario was unthinkable. And while those from other countries try to analyse the impact of IPL on their cricket ecosystems, Indian cricket is immeasurably stronger thanks to the IPL, and a dream that became reality.",sport,https://www.livemint.com/Sports/CnO8bfn9Cn413aKFeAuRTL/IPL-then-and-now.html

Cehnnai skipper MS Dhoni en route his 34-ball 70 not out against Bangalore in Bangalore on Wednesday. Pics/PTI

'When MS Dhoni hits the ball, it stays hit' is an old Chennai saying. But that it stayed hit even when it was a low full toss and when the shot was aimed not towards long-on or midwicket but over the point fence means the saying has a lot of basis. Mohammed Siraj didn't quite believe it as didn't some Chennai players.

'We were gobsmacked' ""It was a Dhoni special. It is amazing when players experience it in this team for the first time. We've got players here who're absolutely gobsmacked the way in which he finished that game. Having seen it so many times, the expectations get so high. But some of the shots that he played tonight — there was one shot towards point in the end, that's one of the top three shots I've seen,"" said Chennai coach Stephen Fleming, who just couldn't stop raving about that shot and the fact that it came when the asking rate was nearly four runs per ball. ""Dhoni's ability to let wide balls go, the presence of mind to be staying in the now, it never ceases to amaze.""

Apart from Dhoni's (70 not out off 34 balls) power-hitting, Fleming was also taken aback by two other knocks, one by Bangalore's AB de Villiers (30-ball 68) and the other by Chennai's Ambati Rayudu (82 off 52 balls). ""De Villiers I thought had won the game for Bangalore because it was a turning track. We had spinners ready to go but his onslaught took them out of play.

"Reports: Ambati Rayudu set to make Team India comeback

He last played for the Indian team in 2016.

Aadya Sharma FEATURED WRITER News 27 Apr 2018, 17:35 IST 8.05K Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email

Ambati Rayudu last played for India in 2016

What's the story?

Having reposed the faith put on him by the Chennai Super Kings, Ambati Rayudu, in a rich vein of form currently, is set to make a comeback to the Indian Team, if reports in The Times of India are to be believed.

""I am excited about his form. He has come out all guns blazing and gives us a few more options,"" MSK Prasad, Chairman of Selectors, told TOI.

In case you didn't know...

The now 32-year-old Rayudu made his first-class debut in 2002 as a teenager and has played for the Under-19 and India 'A' teams.

He joined the rebel Indian Cricket League in 2007, but was granted amnesty by the BCCI in 2009 and joined the IPL the next year.

He made his Team India debut in 2014 but was dropped from the side after their tour to Zimbabwe in 2016.

The heart of the matter

Rayudu, who represented the Mumbai Indians from 2010 until 2017, was roped in by the Chennai Super Kings in the auctions this year and was bumped up the batting to bolster the top-order.

He currently holds the Orange Cap, with 283 runs in six games at an average of 47.16 and two fifties to his name.

The Indian team have been playing musical chairs with their middle-order options, having tried out the likes of KL Rahul, Manish Pandey, Yuvraj Singh, Kedar Jadhav and Dinesh Karthik at No.4.

What's next?

A month after the IPL ends, the Indian team will travel to England to play three T20Is, as many ODIs and five Tests.

Author's take

It has been a roller-coaster ride for Rayudu, an immensely talented batsman who was touted for a bright future in the early 2000s. From being the captain of the Indian Under-19 team in the 2004 World Cup to being blacklisted by the BCCI for playing in the ICL, Rayudu redeemed himself with stellar knocks for the Mumbai Indians.

With the Super Kings, he has re-invented himself at the top of the order, and deserves a return to the side, especially due to his versatility and the plethora of experience he carries.",sport,https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/reports-ambati-rayudu-set-make-team-india-comeback-england-tour-2018

Patiala, April 27

The Patiala Health Department is going to launch a five-week Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccination campaign in district, with a target to cover 49,100 children in the age brackets of nine months to 15 years, from May 1. Measles and Rubella, two viral diseases with common symptoms, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 64,000 deaths annually in India. Health officials said after a survey, children have been identified for MR vaccination of which 70 per cent are school children and rest are anganwadi children. They said in the first 15 days, all government and private schools would be covered. The campaign will also mark the addition of rubella-vaccine, in Patiala’s childhood immunisation programme to address CRS (Congenital rubella syndrome). In fact, the CRS causes birth defects such as irreversible deafness and blindness, in the newborns. Nearly, 40,000 children get affected by this, every year, in India. With this campaign, Punjab will become the 14th state, in the country, to carry out the drive against these diseases. Health officials said it was important that immunisation should be a routine work and not an ad-hock programme. To make this effort count, the Health Department has appointed 8,000 health officials to make this campaign a success.",health,http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/mr-vaccination-drive-to-cover-49-100-kids-in-district/580945.html
"Scientific evidence shows that giving several vaccines at the same time has no negative effect on a child's immune system, with children exposed to several hundred foreign substances that trigger an immune response every day.

April 24-30, 2018 is marked by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as World Immunisation Week, which aims to raise awareness of the importance of immunisation for individual as well as global health.

Here we round up some facts and figures about immunisation and its importance.

1. Immunisation prevents illness, disability and death in all age groups from many vaccine-preventable diseases including cervical cancer, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumonia, polio, rotavirus diarrhoea, rubella and tetanus.

2. Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions, and currently prevents between two to three million deaths a year.

3. All vaccines are rigorously tested before they are approved for use, as well as regularly reassessed and constantly monitored for side effects.

4. Vaccines also provide better immunity than natural infections. Although the immune response to a vaccine is similar to one produced by a natural infection, it is less risky, as they do not put individuals at risk of the disease’s potential complications.

5. Scientific evidence shows that giving several vaccines at the same time has no negative effect on a child’s immune system, with children exposed to several hundred foreign substances that trigger an immune response every day. It can also save time and money, and result in fewer injections and less discomfort for the child.

6. More children are being immunised across the world than ever before. During 2016, an estimated 116.5 million children worldwide received three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP3), protecting them against infectious diseases that can cause serious illness, disability and even death.

7. However, global vaccination coverage has stalled at 86%, with no significant changes during the past year. An estimated 19.5 million infants worldwide are still missing the basic DTP3 vaccine and an additional 1.5 million deaths could be avoided if global vaccination coverage improves.

8. Vaccines can also help limit the spread of antibiotic resistance, which according to the WHO is one of the biggest threats to global health, and is in part caused by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. By vaccinating, we can prevent infections occurring and therefore the need for antibiotics to treat illnesses.

9. Thanks to vaccines, polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, and meningitis A has been nearly eliminated in 26 African countries.

10. There has also been an 84% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2016, and in 2016 the WHO Region of the Americas became the first in the world to have eliminated measles.

More good news is that progress is still being made with vaccines, with a new vaccine against dengue now licensed in several countries, and the first vaccine to protect children against malaria is due to be piloted in three African countries this year. – AFP Relaxnews",health,https://www.star2.com/health/2018/04/28/worldimmunisationweek2018/

This year’s themes are ‘Protected together, #Vaccines Work’ and ‘Vaccines work, Do your part!’. They embody the core message of the overarching slogan of the African Vaccination week which is ‘Vaccinated communities, Healthy communities’.

The last week of April simultaneously marks the World Health Organisation’s World Immunisation Week and the African Vaccination Week. It is a week of hope and determination as focus shifts to a health intervention whose public health impact is hailed to be second only to clean water.

This year’s themes are ‘Protected together, #Vaccines Work’ and ‘Vaccines work, Do your part!’. They embody the core message of the overarching slogan of the African Vaccination week which is ‘Vaccinated communities, Healthy communities’.

In the years before 1980, immunisation in Kenya was carried out on an ad hoc basis through learning institutions and in emergency response to disease outbreaks. Subsequently these efforts were organised to provide a platform for routine immunisation. Today’s child has access to vaccines that help prevent a variety of ailments including hepatitis B, measles, rubella, whooping cough, diphtheria, pneumonia, polio, rotavirus diarrhoea and tetanus.

For rotavirus diarrhoea, while handwashing exclusive breast feeding and sanitation are helpful, they are not enough to prevent disease.

In fact, in the absence of vaccination, this disease will affect almost every child by the age of 3-5, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Infants and young children are most predisposed to severe rotavirus diarrhoea which can be life-threatening.

Those who suffer most are children in developing countries where there are challenges in accessing healthcare.

While diseases like whooping cough are rarely seen nowadays, failure to vaccinate will result in their re-appearance. In 1977, the last natural case of smallpox was reported and by 1979 the disease was eradicated. This positive step was made possible – in part – due to vaccination. To achieve the dream of health for all other diseases are targeted in the same way.

Worldwide, since the advent of vaccination, the number of cases of paralytic polio has reduced by 99%. The next step is to eradicate the disease. This Global Polio Eradication Initiative, which is a public-private partnership, has worldwide polio eradication as its sole aim.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases ever known and is an important cause of death and disability among young children worldwide. Rubella can cause severe birth defects. Already, since 2000, the measles vaccine has averted 20.4 million deaths and there is global commitment for elimination of the disease.

To fully enjoy benefits of vaccination, it is important to consistently ensure that as many children as possible are vaccinated.

Apart from the obvious health benefits, there are economic benefits to be enjoyed. It is estimated that increasing vaccine coverage in low- and middle-income countries by 2030, could result in 24 million people being prevented from falling into poverty due to health expenses.

Immunisation is part of the essential package for healthcare. The 2012 Global Vaccine Action Plan, endorsed by WHO Member States, calls for commitment to ensuring no one misses out on vital immunisations. Further the Addis Declaration of 2016, recognizing every child’s right to health, is a commitment by Governments to invest in their respective immunisation programmes.

The 2015 target was to ensure that at least 90% children completing course of primary vaccination. The 2016 the global completion rate was 86%, falling short of the target.

This 14% represents approximately 19 million children. These children, half of whom reside in war-torn countries, are at a high risk of acquiring vaccine-preventable diseases many of which are life-threatening. An impressive amount of time and effort goes on into the background from policy to planning, logistics and delivery to ensure that we each receive our much-needed shots. This should not be taken for granted.

"Preventing dementia has become a top goal for medical experts as cases continue to rise. The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States.

Now a new large study published in the BMJ medical journal provides evidence that a certain type of common drug may increase the risk of developing dementia.

Researchers concluded that people who took class 3 anticholinergic drugs were more likely to develop dementia, even if they took the drugs years before they developed the condition.

Anticholinergic drugs are able to block a neurotransmitter chemical called acetylcholine in the central or peripheral nervous system.

Depending on which part of the nervous system is affected, it can result in a myriad of reactions.

As a result, it’s been used to treat a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, depression, hay fever, urinary incontinence, and Parkinson’s disease symptoms.

What the study revealed

Researchers looked at 40,770 people with dementia and 283,933 people without the disease between 2006 and 2015 to see if the drugs were associated with an increased risk of the condition.

The researchers were based at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, Purdue and Indiana Universities in the United States, and other institutions. It was funded by the U.K.-based Alzheimer’s Society.

The study found that people with dementia were more likely to have taken the stronger class 3 anticholinergic drugs before they developed dementia. The increased risk varied for different types of drugs, but went up to 30 percent in certain cases.

Dr. Gayatri Devi, a neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and author of “The Spectrum of Hope: An Optimistic and New Approach to Alzheimer’s Disease and other Dementias,” explained that the study was a strong one due to its large size and the use of U.K. healthcare databases.

“Unlike many other studies which rely on patient recall, this study did not, which was a major strength,” Devi told Healthline. “Anticholinergic medications can potentially lower the levels of the brain chemical acetylcholine, which is an important messenger in memory pathways. In this study, use of some (not all) anticholinergic drugs, even as far back as 20 years, previously raised the risk for dementia.”

She pointed out that not all anticholinergic drugs are the same, and some classes didn’t show an increased risk of dementia.

“It was only those drugs with very strong anticholinergic activity that were associated with later dementia,” she said. “Important to note that the drugs did not cause dementia, but the use of the drugs raised the risk for dementia. What this means for us as physicians is to be cautious about the use of such drugs in patients and to use it for as short a time as possible.”

The study’s findings don’t mean patients should always avoid class 3 anticholinergics.

The overall risk to people on these drugs remains relatively low.

For example, a person between 65 and 70 years old has about a 10 percent chance of developing dementia in the next 15 years. If they take anticholinergic antidepressants, they’d have a 19 percent increased risk of dementia. That translates to an additional 1 to 3 more people out of 100 who would receive a dementia diagnosis.

How the research helps doctors, patients

George Savva, PhD, a researcher from University of East Anglia’s School of Health Sciences and one of the co-authors of the study, said the research can provide experts with more evidence to help them make informed decisions about whether or not to prescribe the medication.

“We found that people who had been diagnosed with dementia were up to 30 percent more likely to have been prescribed specific classes of anticholinergic medications,” he said in a statement. “And the association with dementia increases with greater exposure to these types of medication.”

However, Savva and the other researchers made clear they can’t say for certain that this medication causes dementia — just that it’s associated with increased risk.

“It could be that these medications are being prescribed for very early symptoms indicating the onset of dementia,” Savva said. “But because our research shows that the link goes back up to 15 or 20 years before someone is eventually diagnosed with dementia, it suggests that reverse causation, or confounding with early dementia symptoms, probably isn’t the case.”

Dr. Malaz Boustani, MPH, a Regenstrief Institute and Indiana University Center for Aging Research investigator, said in a statement that physicians should think twice about ordering prescriptions for these medications.

Experts already knew that using these drugs could affect cognition and shouldn’t be used in older, frail patients, according to the study authors.

“Physicians should review all the anticholinergic medications — including over-the-counter drugs — that patients of all ages are taking and determine safe ways to take individuals off anticholinergic medications in the interest of preserving brain health,” Boustani said in a statement.

"Preventing dementia has become a top goal for medical experts as cases continue to rise. The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States.

Now a new large study published in the BMJ medical journal provides evidence that a certain type of common drug may increase the risk of developing dementia.

Researchers concluded that people who took class 3 anticholinergic drugs were more likely to develop dementia, even if they took the drugs years before they developed the condition.

Anticholinergic drugs are able to block a neurotransmitter chemical called acetylcholine in the central or peripheral nervous system.

Depending on which part of the nervous system is affected, it can result in a myriad of reactions.

As a result, it’s been used to treat a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, depression, hay fever, urinary incontinence, and Parkinson’s disease symptoms.

What the study revealed

Researchers looked at 40,770 people with dementia and 283,933 people without the disease between 2006 and 2015 to see if the drugs were associated with an increased risk of the condition.

The researchers were based at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, Purdue and Indiana Universities in the United States, and other institutions. It was funded by the U.K.-based Alzheimer’s Society.

The study found that people with dementia were more likely to have taken the stronger class 3 anticholinergic drugs before they developed dementia. The increased risk varied for different types of drugs, but went up to 30 percent in certain cases.

Dr. Gayatri Devi, a neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and author of “The Spectrum of Hope: An Optimistic and New Approach to Alzheimer’s Disease and other Dementias,” explained that the study was a strong one due to its large size and the use of U.K. healthcare databases.

“Unlike many other studies which rely on patient recall, this study did not, which was a major strength,” Devi told Healthline. “Anticholinergic medications can potentially lower the levels of the brain chemical acetylcholine, which is an important messenger in memory pathways. In this study, use of some (not all) anticholinergic drugs, even as far back as 20 years, previously raised the risk for dementia.”

She pointed out that not all anticholinergic drugs are the same, and some classes didn’t show an increased risk of dementia.

“It was only those drugs with very strong anticholinergic activity that were associated with later dementia,” she said. “Important to note that the drugs did not cause dementia, but the use of the drugs raised the risk for dementia. What this means for us as physicians is to be cautious about the use of such drugs in patients and to use it for as short a time as possible.”

The study’s findings don’t mean patients should always avoid class 3 anticholinergics.

The overall risk to people on these drugs remains relatively low.

For example, a person between 65 and 70 years old has about a 10 percent chance of developing dementia in the next 15 years. If they take anticholinergic antidepressants, they’d have a 19 percent increased risk of dementia. That translates to an additional 1 to 3 more people out of 100 who would receive a dementia diagnosis.

"Common antidepressants linked to dementia risk: Study

If you are used to taking commonly prescribed antidepressants, think twice. According to a study, you may be at high risk of developing dementia, even 20 years before the actual diagnosis, a study has warned.

The researchers found greater incidence of dementia among patients prescribed anticholinergic antidepressants, anticholinergic bladder medications as well as anticholinergic Parkinson's disease medications than among older adults who were not prescribed these drugs.

""Anticholinergics, medications that block acetylcholine, a nervous system neurotransmitter, have previously been implicated as a potential cause of cognitive impairment,"" said Noll Campbell, assistant professor at the Purdue University in Indiana.

However, the researchers are yet not aware of ""exactly how anticholinergics might cause dementia"", the researchers said.

For the study, published in the journal BMJ, an international team from the US, UK and Ireland analysed more than 27 million prescriptions as recorded in the medical records of 40,770 patients over age 65 diagnosed with dementia compared to the records of 283,933 older adults without dementia.

""The findings make it clear that clinicians need to carefully consider the anticholinergic burden of their patients and weigh other options,"" said Malaz Boustani, from the US-based Regenstrief Institute.

""Physicians should review all the anticholinergic medications - including over-the-counter drugs - that patients of all ages are taking and determine safe ways to take individuals off anticholinergic medications in the interest of preserving brain health,"" Boustani said.",health,https://www.indiatvnews.com/lifestyle/health-common-antidepressants-linked-to-dementia-risk-study-439671
"A landmark study has linked the long-term use of certain anticholinergic drugs to a higher risk of dementia later on.

This investigation is believed to be the “largest and most detailed” study to date into long-term anticholinergic use and dementia risk.

Anticholinergics work by blocking a chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter, called acetylcholine that carries brain signals for controlling muscles.

They are used to treat a variety of conditions, from Parkinson’s disease and loss of bladder control to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression.

Anticholinergics for depression, such as amitriptyline, dosulepin, and paroxetine, have previously been linked to higher risk of dementia, even when they were used up to 20 years beforehand.

Some studies have also suggested that use of any anticholinergic is linked to raised risk of dementia.

Long-term use of certain anticholinergics

But the new study — which was led by the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the United Kingdom and is now published in The BMJ — discovered that long-term use of only certain types of anticholinergics is linked to higher dementia risk.

It confirms the link to long-term use of anticholinergics for depression, and also for Parkinson’s disease (such as procyclidine) and loss of bladder control (for example, oxybutynin, solifenacin, and tolterodine).

However, the study found no link between increased dementia risk and other anticholinergic drugs, such as antihistamines and medications for abdominal cramps.

For their investigation, the researchers used data from the Clinical Practice Research Database, which contains anonymized records for more than 11 million people across the U.K.

Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden

The dataset used in the analysis included 40,770 dementia patients between the ages of 65 and 99 who were diagnosed during 2006–2015. Each of these was matched to up to seven people who did not have dementia but who were of the same sex and similar age.

The researchers used a system called the Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden (ACB) scale to score the anticholinergic effect of the drugs that the patients had been prescribed.

An ACB score of 1 meant that a drug was “possibly anticholinergic,” whereas a score of 2 or 3 meant that it was “definitely anticholinergic.” Altogether, they analyzed more than 27 million prescriptions.

The team reviewed the records of the patients and their matched controls to count all prescriptions and doses for drugs with an ACB score of 1–3 during the period covering 4–20 years before dementia diagnosis.

They found that 35 percent of the dementia patients and 30 percent of the controls had been prescribed at least one drug with a score of 3 on the ACB scale during that period.

The researchers then carried out a further analysis to take out the effect of factors that might influence the results.

The further analysis revealed that drugs with an ACB score of 3 that had been prescribed for depression, Parkinson’s disease, and loss of bladder control were linked to higher risk of dementia up to 20 years “after exposure.”

No such link was found, however, for drugs that scored 1 on the ACB scale, nor for respiratory and gastrointestinal drugs that scored 3.

Clinicians should ‘be vigilant’

The researchers point out that due to the limitations of their study design, they cannot say whether the anticholinergics directly cause dementia or not.

One possibility is that the people taking the drugs are already in the very early stages of dementia.

But, because the link was present even when exposure took place 15–20 years before dementia was diagnosed, the authors argue that “reverse causation or confounding with early dementia symptoms are less likely explanations.”

They advise clinicians to “continue to be vigilant with respect to the use of anticholinergic drugs,” and to take into account possible long-term, and short-term, effects when they weigh up risks versus benefits.

Importance of the research

Dementia affects around 50 million people worldwide, and every year, 10 million more find out that they have the disease, which will eventually rob them of their ability to remember, think, hold a conversation, and live independently.

“This research is really important,” explains study leader Dr. George Savva, who works in the School of Health Sciences at UEA, “because there are an estimated 350 million people affected globally by depression, and bladder conditions requiring treatment are estimated to affect over 13 percent of men and 30 percent of women in the U.K. and [United States].”

“Many of the treatment options for these conditions,” he continues, “involve medication with anticholinergic effects.”

“Developing strategies to prevent dementia is therefore a global priority.” Dr. George Savva

In an editorial article that is linked to the study, Prof. Shelly Gray, from the University of Washington in Seattle, and Prof. Joseph Hanlon, from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, say that the authors did a good job of addressing the problem of how best to “summarize anticholinergic burden for future research.”

They also agree that, in the meantime, “As suggested by guidelines, anticholinergics in general should be avoided in older adults.”",health,http://www.infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/en_GB/health/these-common-drugs-may-raise-your-risk-of-dementia/

"Not long before her 7th birthday, Amelia Eldred, a small dancer with big dreams of performing on stage, received a devastating diagnosis.

Doctors discovered a 10-centimeter tumor in the femur in her left leg — and it had broken the bone, according to Birmingham Live. When it did not respond to chemotherapy, doctors told her parents that the limb would need to be amputated, but they had a solution to help the active child maintain her mobility, according to the British news site.

During a rare and complex medical procedure this year, surgeons in central England amputated Amelia’s leg at the thigh, removed the central portion and then reattached the lower leg to the upper leg – backward. The young girl will eventually be able to use her ankle as a knee joint and simply fit her foot into a prosthetic so she can walk, run and dance once again, according to Birmingham Live.

“It doesn’t feel that different,” Amelia told BBC News this week, tracing the scars on her leg. “But it is different when I have to move ’cause it’s the other way around — when I move it up or down or side to side, I go the other way ’cause it’s the wrong way around.”

Amelia, from Tamworth, a town in Staffordshire, not far from Birmingham, was diagnosed last year with a form of bone cancer called osteosarcoma, or osteogenic sarcoma, according to Birmingham Live.

Her mother, Michelle Eldred, told Birmingham Live that Amelia’s leg “gave way” while she was playing last summer, and although her parents tried to nurse the injury, her limb continued to swell.

Eldred took her daughter to a nearby hospital, and was then sent to Birmingham Children’s Hospital, where doctors confirmed the diagnosis, she said.

“I called my husband, Richard, and when they took us into a room with comfy chairs and tissues, I knew it was bad news,” the mother told the news site.

Osteosarcoma, which is the most common type of bone cancer in children, typically affects the femur and tibia in the upper and lower leg and the humerus in the upper arm, according to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. When treated early, the long-term survival rate is 70 to 75 percent, according to the children’s hospital.

Such tumors can be treated with chemotherapy or surgery, such as rotationplasty – a procedure most commonly used to treat tumors in children in which the lower leg is turned 180 degrees, essentially turning the ankle into a knee.

In January, Amelia had the operation.

Prof. Lee Jeys, a surgeon who performed the procedure at Royal Orthopedic Hospital in Birmingham, said this week that before Amelia went into surgery, she bid farewell to the “loser” tumor.

“She was the perfect patient to have this procedure and even said ‘goodbye loser’ to the cancer as we prepared to amputate,” he said in the statement.

“She has shown real bravery and confidence in showing off her leg, even though it looks a bit different. I’m glad that she’ll be able to continue doing all the things a normal child can do including sports and dancing.”

Amelia’s mother could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday but told BBC News that the procedure was her daughter’s best option.

“This way, she’ll be able to then get a prosthetic leg,” Eldred said, telling her 7-year-old daughter that she will be able to “do all the things you used to love to do and all your and all your sports and your dancing.”

Family members and friends have started donating to a JustGiving page to help the child’s parents keep her fitted with prosthetic activity blades.

In the end, Amelia’s mother said she thinks her daughter’s dream will come true.

“Amelia has always been an active child, she attended various clubs: Swimming, athletics at school, street dancing, ballet and tap, acrobatics and gymnastics. In addition she loves riding her bike and running. She dreams one day to return to dancing and perform on a stage,” Eldred told Birmingham Live about her child. But Eldred added that since the surgery this year, Amelia has also developed some new dreams. “She talks of how her new leg will enable her to travel the world one day and maybe even enter the Paralympics.”

“People ask how we cope, but we take our lead from Amelia, she has been so positive about all this,” Eldred told the news site. “She has been so brave through all this — just before her surgery she waved to her leg and said ‘bye, bye tumor, see you loser!’ After her surgery, one of the nurses overheard her say to another child: ‘There’s nothing wrong with being different.’ “",health,https://www.denverpost.com/2018/04/27/leg-amputation-surgery-attached-wrong-way-cancer/

"Amelia was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer just before her 7th birthday last year. Following several months of chemotherapy, surgeons decided that her leg must be amputated.

In January this year Amelia had surgery to remove her leg and during very innovative surgery her ankle joint was attached to her thigh to act as her knee joint. It was called a rotationplasty.



This will enable Amelia to run around with her friends and continue with her love of dancing lessons and gymnastics. She will need prosthetic activity blades which are not available on NHS.

This means we will need to raise in excess of £30,000 to provide blades until she reaches adulthood. Each blade costs around £5000.

"Seven-year-old Amelia Eldred had an unusal procedure to treat her bone cancer, called rotationplasty, in which part of her leg was amputated and reattached backwards. Above, Amelia with her mother Michelle.

When Amelia Eldred, an active 7-year old in England, needed her leg amputated to treat bone cancer, doctors performed an unusual surgery: They removed the middle part of her leg, then reattached the lower part of her leg — but backward.

While the surgery sounds odd — it results in a foot that's at knee-height, facing the back of the body — doctors say it can allow children to have a more active lifestyle and better leg function, compared with other treatment options, such as a full-leg amputation. In this case, Amelia's backward food acts as a knee joint.

""Straight away, it was the best option for us,"" Amelia's mom, Michelle Eldred, told the BBC. With a lower-leg prosthesis, the girl will be able to do all the things she loves to do, including dancing and sports. But with a full-leg amputation, she would be unlikely to have a good range of movement, Eldred said. [27 Oddest Medical Cases]

The surgery that Amelia received is a rare procedure known as rotationplasty, which is used to treat bone tumors that occur near the knee, according to the Dana-Farber/Boston Children's and Blood Disorders Center. In this case, Amelia was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, the most common type of bone cancer in children, which caused an aggressive tumor in her left femur (or thigh) bone, according to the British news outlet Birmingham Live.

In an operation of this type, doctors first remove the middle section of the leg, which includes the bottom of the femur bone, the knee and the upper tibia bone. Then, they take the remaining portion of the lower leg, rotate it 180 degrees and reattach it to the femur. The foot is turned backward, so it can function as a knee joint, according to Dana-Farber/Boston Children's.

With a prosthesis attached over the foot, the patient's leg essentially functions like it would with a below-the-knee amputation, said Dr. Joel Mayerson, an orthopedic oncologist at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, who was not involved with the case. That's important, because with an above-the-knee amputation, patients need to expend about 70 percent more energy than normal to walk with a prosthesis, but with a below-the-knee amputation, the energy expenditure is just 20 percent above normal, Mayerson said.

""This is a good alternative to allow them to be very functional with modern prosthesis use,"" Mayerson told Live Science.

Rotationplasty is most often performed on children under age 12, who are generally better at retraining their brains to use their ankle as their knee joint, according to Dana-Farber/Boston Children's. In addition, young children still have a lot of growing to do, which can make other treatment options for bone cancer more challenging.

For example, a procedure called limb-salvage surgery can be used to treat osteosarcoma, but that technique requires doctors to replace a section of the patient's bone with a metal implant or a cadaver bone. These materials don't grow with the child, though, so a young child will need multiple surgeries to make the limb longer so it can grow with the child, Mayerson said. In contrast, with rotationplasty, ""most of the time, it's one surgery and you're done,"" he said.

Another advantage to rotationplasty is that it allows children to maintain a very active lifestyle — including participating in high-impact activities, such as running and jumping, which wouldn't be possible with limb-salvage surgery, Dana-Farber/Boston Children's said. Patients who have rotationplasty also avoid the phantom limb pain that typically occurs with a traditional amputation, according to Stanford Children's Health, because the nerves in the lower leg are preserved.

Amelia was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in August 2017 and had several chemotherapy treatments before undergoing the rotationplasty surgery in January, according to Birmingham Live. A recent scan shows that Amelia's bones are fusing together well following the operation, Birmingham Live reported.

Amelia ""has shown real bravery and confidence in showing off her leg, even though it looks a bit different,"" Dr. Lee Jeys, a consultant orthopedic surgeon at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham, England, who performed the procedure, said in a statement. ""I'm glad that she'll be able to continue doing all the things a normal child can do, including sports and dancing.""

"A young British girl has had her leg amputated and re-attached backwards so her ankle can eventually replace the leg’s original knee following a struggle with bone cancer.

Amelia Eldred, who was diagnosed with the cancer last year, kept a brave face as she spoke about her leg, flexing the foot all the way to her face.

“When I look in the mirror it looks strange and then when I look at it face to face it looks normal,” Eldred, 7, told Reuters.

The rotationplasty procedure was carried out at the Royal Orthopedic Hospital in Birmingham. Doctors hope the procedure will allow the young girl to walk in the future by using her ankle as a knee joint with the aid of a prosthetic limb.

“If she hadn’t had this other procedure she’d have had to have an amputation just below the hip joint and that would have been very difficult for her to wear a prosthesis and it would have been very difficult for her to have a good level of mobility,” Royal Orthopaedic Hospital consultant Lee Jeys said. “But now she has a good knee joint and a good hip joint.”

Fundraisers have been set up for the girl to develop the right prosthetic as she hopes she’ll eventually be able to do her favourite activities, including dancing.

The limb is rotated because the ankle flexes in the opposite direction compared to the knee. The benefit to the patient is that they have a functioning knee joint and can run and jump. This procedure saved Amelia from having an amputation at the hip and will mean she can continue to enjoy an active life in the future.

Real bravery

Amelia was incredibly brave throughout the entire procedure and was supported by her amazing family and friends. She is a keen dancer and now has the opportunity to dance again following her operation at The Royal Orthopaedic Hospital.

Professor Lee Jeys completed the procedure and has been very happy with Amelia's progress.

""She was the perfect patient to have this procedure and even said 'goodbye loser' to the cancer as we prepared to amputate. She has shown real bravery and confidence in showing off her leg, even though it looks a bit different. I'm glad that she'll be able to continue doing all the things a normal child can do including sports and dancing.""

Oncology at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital

The Royal Orthopaedic Hospital is a leading centre for orthopaedic oncology. The team specialises in the diagnosis and treatment of benign and malignant tumors of bone and soft tissues and carries out a number of ground-breaking procedures.

The Royal Orthopaedic Hospital is known for it's ground-breaking work and earlier in the year was the first NHS hospital in the country to beging using the MAKO robotic arm during hip and knee replacements.",health,https://www.roh.nhs.uk/about-us/news/381-helping-brave-amelia-dance-again

A seven-year-old Tamworth girl who lost her leg to bone cancer is determined to dance again - and had an incredible operation so her dreams can come true.

Amelia Eldred was diagnosed with an osteosarcoma in her left femur in August last year. She underwent three five-week chemotherapy sessions, then surgery to amputate the affected limb.

Amelia’s hobbies include swimming, athletics, running and bike riding – and she has vowed that one day she will dance on stage once more.

So far the plucky Kingsbury Primary School pupil has amazed doctors with her rapid adaptation to losing her leg – and fundraisers have rallied round to help her achieve her dream.

Surgery to remove the tumour was carried out by Professor Lee Jeys at Royal Orthopaedic Hospital using a rare procedure called rotationplasty where Amelia’s leg was amputated high up her thigh, then the lower leg reattached the wrong way around, meaning that her heel will eventually work as a knee joint, with her foot slipping in to a prosthetic.

Her mum Michelle Eldred said: “Amelia has now started another cycle of chemo and has one more cycle to go, plus day clinic treatment till the end of the year.

“Following her surgery she is healing very well and amazing the doctors with how quickly she is moving the adapted leg and foot.”

Amelia became ill in the first week of the school summer holidays last year while attending a playscheme, when her leg ‘gave way’ beneath her and began to swell.

Her parents Michelle and Richard tried putting cold compresses on it, but the swelling remained. Staff at the Robert Peel said they thought she had burst a blood vessel, but a week later, the swelling remained.

Michelle said: “We took her back to the Robert Peel. They x-rayed her and we were sent straight to the Birmingham Children’s Hospital A and E where they confirmed she had a 10cm tumour on her femur, which had actually fractured the bone.

“I called my husband Richard and when they took us into a room with comfy chairs and tissues, I knew it was bad news.

“After that it was MRIs and other scans.”

On Amelia’s seventh birthday last August, a biopsy revealed that it was an aggressive high grade tumour, which had not shrunk after two rounds of chemotherapy. Amelia and her parents were told that her leg would need to be amputated.

The surgery was carried out in January and a recent scan has shown that the bones are fusing together well.

In around three months’ time, Amelia will be able to put weight on her leg and have a prosthesis fitted, but an NHS prosthesis is not a practical solution for a lively girl like Amelia to do all the activities she loves so much. The Eldred family live in Kingsbury and parishioners at Kingsbury Methodist Church are among those who have started fundraising for her. They hope to raise around £30,000 to ensure that Amelia can have specially-made ‘blades’, like those used by Jonny Peacock on Strictly Come Dancing, one of Amelia’s favourite shows.

Michelle added: “Amelia has always been an active child, she attended various clubs: swimming, athletics at school, street dancing, ballet and tap, acrobatics and gymnastics. In addition she loves riding her bike and running! She dreams one day to return to dancing and perform on a stage. She was looking to join a new gymnastics club in Tamworth, before her diagnosis.

“I do believe that Amelia will aspire to her dreams. She is very determined and everyone that knows her and has met her at both the Orthopaedic and Birmingham Children’s Hospital are amazed by her courage and positivity through her journey so far. She talks of how her new leg will enable her to travel the world one day and maybe even enter the Paralympics!

“People ask how we cope, but we take our lead from Amelia, she has been so positive about all this. She has been so brave through all this – just before her surgery she waved to her leg and said ‘bye, bye tumour, see you loser!’ After her surgery, one of the nurses overheard her say to another child: ‘there’s nothing wrong with being different!’

“We’ve tried to keep everything as normal as possible, so daddy stills goes to work, mummy works from hospital when she’s in here and Amelia goes to school when she is able to.

Cheques should be made payable to Kingsbury Methodist Church ‘Amelia’s Fund’.",health,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/brave-amelia-leg-reattached-backwards-14550641
"Patients suffering from Type II diabetes are at a higher risk of contracting liver cirrhosis due to increasing prevalence of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), data collected by a city-based hospital shows.

Narayana Multi-specialty Hospital said that it has received around 500 cases of liver ailments in the past one year of which 50% of the patients were already suffering from Type II diabetes. It said that these patients were at a higher risk of contracting liver cirrhosis. Most of the patients were in the age group of 40 to 60 years.

It said that people of the city are more vulnerable to liver ailments and failures owing to the high prevalence of Type II diabetes. A study was done in south Gujarat and published in the Journal of Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences also shows that there are now higher incidences of NAFLD in such patients. A 2017 study published in International Journal of Research in Medical Sciences suggests that around 9-32% of general population in India suffers from NAFLD, and that its prevalence has doubled in the last 20 years.

According to reports, abo-ut 10 lakh patients are being diagnosed with liver cirrhosis every year in the country. The primary reasons of the incidence of the disease are alcohol abuse and NAFLD.

""Liver cirrhosis occurs when there is an irreversible scarring of the liver and a permanent loss of liver cells. The incidence of diabetes and fatty liver disease together is deadly as it makes a patient resistant to insulin apart from unleashing other complications,"" Dr Nirav Vakani, consultant, Gastroenterology-Surgical, at the hospital said.

He warned that the disease is getting more common in younger people as the country grapples with obesity and other lifestyle-related ailments.",health,http://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-gujarat-beware-cases-of-fatty-liver-diseases-on-the-rise-in-city-2609468
"According to the WHO, liver disease is the 10th most common cause of deaths in India. Gone are the days when liver disease was only associated with the consumption of alcohol. With the increased prevalence of obesity and metabolic diseases such as diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver, which leads to hepatitis and eventually cirrhosis, is an emerging problem. More than a million new patients are diagnosed with liver cirrhosis every year globally, and the major causes for it are non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatitis B and C. Epidemiologic studies suggest the prevalence of NAFLD in nine per cent to 32 per cent of the general population in India. Dr Palaniyamma D., Medical Advisor, The Himalaya Drug Company, says people who are overweight or obese and lead a sedentary lifestyle are at risk of NAFLD. The prevalence is especially common in those who eat highly processed food. The five best foods to be included in the diet to regulate this condition are:

Greens: Green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, cabbage, and sprouts help in general weight loss by preventing fat build-up in the liver.

Oatmeal: Oats are packed with dietary fibre and help a person feel full for a longer period, thus serving as a filling breakfast or snack and increasing the body’s energy levels.

Sunflower Seeds: These seeds are high in the antioxidant vitamin E, which helps protect the liver from further damage, and are a healthy snack for munching in between meals.

Garlic: This popular flavour-enhancing ingredient helps burn extra fat, which in turn helps in reducing weight.

Fish: Rich in omega-3 fatty acid, fish is an excellent food that improves liver function and reduces inflammation.

If NAFLD is detected and managed at an early stage, it is possible to reduce the amount of fat in the liver and prevent the condition from worsening.

Adopting a healthy lifestyle is the first step towards managing NAFLD. Reducing weight, eating healthy, exercising moderately, and avoiding alcohol can reduce the risk of NAFLD. Consuming alcohol does not cause NAFLD, but it can worsen the condition.

Medicines can be useful in managing the symptoms associated with this condition. Using medications that have natural ingredients can restore the functional efficiency of the liver. Formulations containing natural ingredients such as The Caper Bush (Himsra) and Chicory (Kasani) improve the functional efficiency of the liver, protect the liver structure, boost liver health, and remove toxins from the body.

The liver carries out various functions that are critical for good health. It helps break down food, purify blood, build proteins, remove harmful substances, balance hormones, and store energy. Hence, it is advisable to consume a healthy diet and supplements containing herbal ingredients that help the liver metabolise foods, eliminate waste, and balance hormones.",health,https://www.thekashmirmonitor.net/2018/04/28/5-natural-ways-to-fight-non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/

Chandigarh, April 27

Get your child vaccinated as viruses are mutating and becoming antibiotic resistant, as this has been the observation of doctors at Advance Paediatric Centre (APC) in the PGI who are grappling with the new challenge these days. Earlier, the infections used to be treated by using simple antibiotics, but nowadays the antibiotics do not respond to viruses. “Earlier, we used to give routine antibiotics to the typhoid patient at our OPD. But now the situation has changed. We are observing that the fever is not receding even after 10 or 15 days of treatment, which means that antibiotics are not working,” said Dr Sanjay Verma.

Balance the role

of antibiotics

Dr Joseph Mathew from the Department of Paediatrics, PGI, said there should be a judicious use of antibiotics. He said, “Viruses are evolving and the antibiotics are no longer effective. The genetic makeup of virus evolves when it is suppressed for a long time and then the virus finds mechanism to fight against the antibiotic for its survival,” said Dr Mathew.

Vaccines are important

Dr Joseph Mathew further stressed that child vaccination are as important as water in every household. He said although the immunisation coverage in the country has increased from 35 per cent in the year 1992-93 to 62 per cent in 2015-16, an estimated 7.2 million children still miss out on essential vaccines and are at risk of death from diseases which were entirely preventable. Dr Bhavneet Bharti, a paediatrician, said the vaccines under Universal Immunisation Programme are provided free-of-cost by the government and are available at all government dispensaries and hospitals. “In PGI we vaccinate nearly 17,000 children annually,” said Dr Bharti. ‘Bachchan’s ad on MR vaccine misleading’ Dr Neeraj Goya from the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) has a complaint against actor Amitabh Bachchan, who is a brand ambassador of MR Campaign. He said, ""In an advertisement, Bachchan says if children suffer from fever on being administered MR vaccine, it means that the vaccine is working. Now, if the child doesn't suffer from fever, they call us and complain that the vaccine has not worked and give reference of senior Bachchan's advertisement,"" Dr Neeraj Goya.",health,http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/viruses-posing-challenge-to-pgi-paediatricians/581009.html
"Cervical cancer is caused due to HPV or human papillomavirus. The best way to prevent this cancer is to get vaccinated. The HPV vaccine is known to be the best way to prevent cervical cancer. According to the data released in 2017 by the HPV centre every year 122844 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 67477 dies from the disease. Cervical cancer ranks as the 2nd most frequent cancer among women in India and the 2nd most frequent cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age.

HPV is a group of more than 200 viruses and among them; at least 40 types of HPV can be spread by skin-to-skin contact. They can either spread through sexual intercourse or from the skin and mucous membrane of the infected person. But mostly an HPV infection is passed through sexual intercourse – vaginal, oral or anal. However, HPV 16 and 18 are the stains that are responsible for causing cervical cancer. The most common cause of cervical cancer is having unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners or experiencing a sexual intercourse at a very early age. Read to know if condoms can prevent an HPV infection.

However, keeping the vaginal area clean can help to reduce the risk of cervical cancer. It might not be able to prevent cancer completely but proper hygiene practices can definitely reduce the chances of getting infected with the virus. This not only means keeping the area clean but also maintaining good sexual hygiene. For women, it is necessary to insist the partner to wear a condom while having intercourse. But condom cannot give total protection from HPV. If there are warts and lesions in the area (infected by HPV) that are not covered by the condom and if they come in contact with any parts of the woman it can still spread the infection. Still, condom during sex is necessary. It is necessary to clean the area after sex wipe the vagina with a clean cloth or vaginal wipes from back to front to make sure that virus doesn’t stay in the area.

In fact, a breast and cervical cancer screening camp help at Cooper Corporation and Onco-Life, a Cancer Centre, Shendre, Satara had seen that of the 1500 women who attended the camp around 14 percent were detected to have either breast cancer or cervical cancer. The doctors at the camp came to the conclusion that most of the cervical cancer detected in Pap smear was due to lack of hygiene. So, maintaining proper hygiene helps to keep cancer at bay.

But this is not to say that you can skip the cervical cancer vaccination and maintain proper hygiene to prevent an HPV infection or avoid going for screening. In fact, regular screening can help one detect the infection early and get treated for the same. It is necessary that woman should watch out for symptoms like abnormal bleeding, unusual heavy discharge, pelvic pain, pain during urination and unexpected bleeding as the possible signs of the cervical cancer diagnosis. Women at 65 and above years of age should definitely undergo screening, if they haven’t been screened since the age of 50 years or if they recently had abnormal tests. As the risk of cervical cancer is very low in women who have never had sex and maintain good hygiene quotient, women in this category may opt not to have cervical screening. Apart from this, maintaining proper hygiene can also help to reduce incidences of cervical cancer.

"When it comes to cancer, a healthy dose of skepticism can be good for your health, especially when evaluating “miracle cancer cures” found on the internet.

In my work at the Loma Linda University Cancer Center, I treat a wide variety of female patients and help them come to terms with what is often a very frightening diagnosis.

One thing that can make the specter of cancer more challenging than it needs to be is the profusion of misleading information online, in social media and on television and radio.

Here are 10 cancer myths that I’ve encountered over the years that can be particularly misleading to women and sometimes downright dangerous:

A cancer diagnosis is an automatic death sentence. Actually, recent research findings have produced several new diagnostic and treatment options for cancer patients. As a result, five-year survival rates for some forms of cancer currently exceed 90 percent. Even when the most aggressive cancers — lung, breast, pancreatic, colorectal and ovarian — are factored in, the five-year survival rate is still around 66 percent, according to the Journal of the National Cancer institute. That’s significantly better than a few years ago.

Sugar enhances the growth of cancer. We all know that eating too much sugar is bad for our health, but eliminating it altogether after receiving a cancer diagnosis is not good or necessary, nor will it directly impact the cancer growth. Sugar is a two-edged sword. While it is not a direct cause of cancer, excessive sugar consumption can lead to obesity, which has been linked to cancer. Moderation is the key. Most cancer patients can enjoy some sugar so long as they don’t overdo it.

Exposure to air during surgery makes cancer grow. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that air exposure during surgery increases the spread of cancer cells. Cancer surgery is done cautiously by a trained professional to assure minimizing the risk of spreading non-metastatic cancer. Air exposure is not detrimental to a healthy recovery in any way.

Herbal products fight cancer. Despite all the stories alleging the cancer-fighting properties of “miracle” fruits, vegetables and sea creatures, women should never forego cancer screening and treatment just because they eat kale, do yoga or practice alternative medicine. Some of those things may be good for managing symptoms, such as relieving pain or anxiety, but they cannot cure cancer and should never be used as a substitute for treatment using evidence-based best practices. The idea that they can is a deadly deception, which has caused some women to wait too long to seek diagnosis and treatment. Also, some herbal products and supplements actually interfere with conventional cancer therapy. Notify your doctor if you are taking any of them.

If someone in my family has cancer, I will definitely get it, too. Genetic predisposition to cancer is a hot topic right now. While some studies have shown that some cancer syndromes are family related, the National Cancer Institute says they only account for 5 to 10 percent of all cancers. But most cancers are sporadic. Just because you have a family member with cancer does not mean you will get it. If you inherited the cancer gene, your odds of avoiding cancer can be greatly increased by frequent cancer screenings, and possibly, risk-reducing surgery. That’s why I prescribe genetic testing and counseling for women who have relatives with cancer and meet certain criteria for testing. Genetic counseling laws vary by state.

If no one in my family has cancer, I won’t get it either. The National Cancer Institute estimates that as many as 40 percent of all Americans will get some form of cancer during the course of their lives. Because of that, I recommend that every woman adhere to the recommended screening schedule for breast, cervical, colon and possibly other cancers. Screening frequency may vary from woman to woman. Many forms of cancer that can be treated successfully in the early stages can prove fatal if diagnosed too late. No woman should ever consider herself immune to cancer. Cancer screening is the only way to know for certain.

Cancer is contagious. Unlike the flu or common cold, most cancers are not spread person-to-person. However, there are two potential exceptions to the rule. First, people who receive an organ or tissue donation from an infected donor may be at a slightly increased risk, although the risk is greatly reduced by stringent screening procedures designed to prevent people with cancer from donating organs. Second, although certain viruses and bacteria that have been associated with cancer — such as the human papillomavirus (HPV) or H. pylori — can be passed from person to person, the cancers sometimes associated with them cannot be directly transmitted to others.

Artificial sweeteners cause cancer. While early studies showed that cyclamate, when used in combination with saccharine, caused bladder cancer in laboratory animals, subsequent tests failed to demonstrate a similar result in humans. Similarly, recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration studies of other artificial sweeteners have also found no evidence that they cause cancer. In the long run, they may actually be good for humans. They’re sweeter than sugar, so we use less, but they don’t promote obesity.

Hair dyes cause cancer. Although some ingredients commonly used in commercial hair dyes in the 1970s were linked to cancer, the harmful elements have been removed so that for most women, the occasional use of hair dyes is not dangerous. However, there is one caveat to that rule: hairdressers, who use a variety of dyes, straighteners and other powerful chemicals in their work on a daily basis may be at increased risk of bladder cancer, according to some findings.

Attitude determines whether you will get cancer or not. Studies have found that people with a positive attitude do not fare any better at beating cancer than people with a negative outlook. A positive attitude can help us make more friends and enjoy life more than a sour disposition, but it does nothing to prevent or defeat cancer.

Two tips for staying healthy. While nothing can completely inoculate anyone against cancer, there are two things that can increase the odds of staying healthy and cancer-free.

The first is to drink water instead of sugary drinks. Pure water, as opposed to soft drinks and other beverages, helps to decrease dehydration and thus the acidity of the body. It can also help manage excess calories and decrease the risk of obesity. We know that a number of cancers are associated with obesity.

The second is to get vaccinated. Many vaccines target cancers of the cervix, vagina and vulva. Since some of those cancers can be caused by the human papilloma virus, I strongly recommend that girls and young women between the ages of 9 and 26 get the HPV vaccine, which has been shown to protect against cancer. Other vaccinations are available for older women.

Additional information about cancer is available online from the National Cancer Institute and the Loma Linda University Cancer Center.

"Dear Dr. Roach: I have a follow-up question regarding the risk of cervical cancer from HPV and herpes. I have had cervical cancer and exposure to DES. You did not mention if this particular estrogen exposure is a risk factor, but I wonder.

M.M.

Dear M.M.: Diethylstilbestrol, or DES, is a synthetic estrogen, which was used mostly in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent premature birth and miscarriages. It was shown to be ineffective. Worse, in 1971, it was shown that DES increased the risk of breast cancer in the women who were given it. Worse still, the daughters born to women who had taken DES (called “DES daughters”) were at risk for an unusual cancer, called “clear cell cancer of the vagina and cervix.” (This is not the usual cervical cancer, which is almost always caused by HPV.)

They usually developed this cancer in their teens and 20s. However, women born to DES-treated mothers should continue to be screened for vaginal cancer their whole lives.

The risk of other cancers in DES daughters is a subject of debate. Although DES daughters do have increased risk of cervical abnormalities, there has been no clear increase in risk of the common form of cervical cancer.

There also may be a higher breast cancer risk. Due to the uncertainty, any woman born to a DES-treated mother should get lifelong, annual vaginal and cervical cancer screening, discuss frequency of breast cancer with her doctor (who needs to know about the DES exposure) and consider being part of the registry at tinyurl.com/DES-daughters.

Men born to DES-treated women do not have an increased risk for cancer, and granddaughters of DES-treated women do not have adverse effects, as far as is known.

Dear Dr. Roach: I read your column about the parents of the 40-year-old son with depression. I have depression, and it took 10 months of trying multiple medications before I started to respond. Many of the symptoms and feelings I had during this time were worse than how I felt before taking any medicine, so I know how this gentleman feels. You truly can feel like it is hopeless. I am writing to tell the parents that it can take a long time, but I hope their son doesn’t give up. What works for one person may not work for another. I have been stable on my meds for two years, am happy and am back to my normal self. Just let them know to tell their son how much they love him, and please don’t give up.

D.

Dear D.: Thank you for your kind letter. I am sure your message of hope will be a reassurance for those family members who have a loved one with severe depression.

"Action Points Firefighters who responded to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) had a two to three times greater prevalence of multiple myeloma precursor conditions as compared with a control population.

Another WTC study showed a projection that the Fire Department of the City of New York-World Trade Center Health Program cohort will experience a greater cancer burden than would be expected from a demographically similar population.

Firefighters who responded to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) and survived had a two to three times greater prevalence of multiple myeloma precursor conditions as compared with a control population, a long-term follow-up study showed.

The prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) was 1.8 times greater in the firefighters, and light-chain MGUS occurred more than three times as often in the firefighters as in a control group of men without environmental exposure to the WTC.

Additionally, 16 WTC-exposed firefighters had multiple myeloma diagnoses during follow-up to July 2017, 14 of whom had serum or urine for monoclonal protein/light-chain assessment. Seven of the 14 firefighters had light-chain myeloma. The myeloma diagnoses occurred at a median age of 57 -- significantly younger than the median age at diagnosis for the general population of patients with myeloma.

Collectively, the findings suggested that environmental exposure to the WTC disaster site is associated with myeloma precursor disease and may be a risk factor for development of myeloma at an early age, Ola Landgren, MD, PhD, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, and co-authors reported online in JAMA Oncology.

""Taken together, our results show that environmental exposure due to the WTC attacks is associated with myeloma precursor disease ... and may be a risk factor for the development of multiple myeloma at an earlier age, particularly the light-chain subtype.""

Authors of a second report in the same issue of the journal concluded that fire and rescue workers at the WTC site have a significantly higher risk of developing several types of cancer and that the first-year cost of treating the cancers will be $236 million over a 20-year period.

Caveats

The author of an accompanying editorial, however, suggested a need for cautious evaluation and interpretation of the data from the two studies.

""The WTC attack is an emotional subject,"" wrote Otis W. Brawley, MD, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""Cancer is also an emotional subject. There is a tendency to want to blame something for every diagnosed cancer. We often attribute cancer to some environmental exposure. When these WTC heroes are diagnosed as having a cancer, even a cancer common in the population, there is a natural tendency to assume it is due to their service at the WTC.""

Brawley noted that the small number of myeloma cases (16) makes it difficult to establish a firm correlation with WTC service. With regard to the MGUS analyses, a previous study established that firefighters have an increased risk of MGUS and myeloma as compared with the general population. A more appropriate comparison group for the study would have been firefighters from another large city, said Brawley.

Pointing out that ""correlation does not mean causation,"" he mused that ""perhaps this issue is beyond the limits of science.""

The authors of the myeloma/MGUS studies recognized the limitations of their data and agreed with Brawley's caveats, said co-author Amit Verma, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, N.Y. Nonetheless, the findings inform discussions about the the potential cancer risk faced by firefighters who had exposure to the WTC site.

""The bottom line is that our study shows this increase in MGUS, which is absolutely real, in comparison to a general population,"" Verma told MedPage Today. ""Is it all WTC exposure, or is firefighter exposure also related to this? We cannot answer that in this study.""

The increased risk of specific cancers found in the second study is intriguing, but ""are the predicted increases due to WTC exposure or a career as a firefighter?"" Brawley asked.

MGUS Study

Rescue and recovery workers at the WTC site were exposed to large quantities of potentially carcinogenic substances. Several reports since then have documented modestly elevated rates of cancer among workers at the site. The reports included several case series suggesting an increased incidence of myeloma, especially myeloma with onset at a younger age, among workers at the WTC site. Most new cases of myeloma involve patients age 65 or older, and onset before 50 is uncommon, Landgren and co-authors noted.

In the general population of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, about 80% have disease associated with expression of IgH (monoclonal [M]-protein), and 20% have abnormal light-chain proteins in peripheral blood. Data from a large screening study showed that myeloma associated with IgH and light-chain secretion is preceded by the respective precursor states of MGUS and light-chain MGUS.

The etiology of MGUS and light-chain MGUS remains unclear, but previous studies suggested an association with exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, including substances to which firefighters and search-and-rescue workers were exposed at the WTC site, the authors continued.

To gain insight into the association, Landgren and colleagues studied 16 WTC-exposed white male firefighters who had new diagnoses of myeloma from Sept. 12, 2001 to July 1, 2017. The team also conducted a screening study for myeloma precursor disease in an additional 781 WTC-exposed white male firefighters older than 50, comparing findings with data on a well-studied cohort of men in Olmsted County, Minn.

The investigators used medical records to evaluate the 16 firefighters with myeloma, and obtained serum samples from 1,173 WTC-exposed firefighters. The team excluded samples from men who had myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses before the serum draw, as well as samples from participants younger than 50 or older than 79, leaving a cohort of 781 white, male, WTC-exposed firefighters. The Olmsted County cohort included 7,612 men age 50 to 79.

The Olmsted cohort had an overall MGUS prevalence of 4.4%, with MGUS accounting for 3.4% and light-chain MGUS for 1.0%. The numbers translated into an age-standardized prevalence rate (ASR) of 4.34 per 100 persons. In contrast, the firefighters had an ASR of 7.63 per 100, a 1.8-fold increase versus the Olmsted County reference group. The firefighters had an ASR of 3.08 per 100 for light-chain MGUS, compared with 0.98 for the reference group, a 3.1-fold difference in relative risk.

The ASR for MGUS only was numerically greater among the WTC-exposed firefighters, but the difference did not achieve statistical significance (4.55 versus 3.36 per 100 persons).

The authors evaluated ASRs by arrival time by the firefighters' arrival time at the WTC site and duration of time at the site. MGUS and light-chain MGUS ASRs were consistently greater among the firefighters, but the data did not show an exposure gradient.

WTC Cancer Burden

The second report about WTC exposure and cancer represented an analysis of 12,374 New York fire department workers involved in the initial response and subsequent search-and-rescue efforts at the WTC site. Rachel Zeig-Owens, DrPH, of the FDNY (Fire Department of the City of New York) World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) in Brooklyn, N.Y., and co-authors used health claims data to estimate the 20-year aggregate costs of first-year cancer care for the workers.

The study focused on workers who were at the WTC site at any time from Sept. 11, 2001 to July 25, 2002. The authors projected that the cohort would have new 2,960 new cancer diagnoses. A subgroup analysis focused on white males, as men accounted for 97% of the workers, 87% of whom were white. For comparison, the authors used cancer rates for New York City.

The data suggested that the white male subgroup would develop significantly more (P<0.001) cancers of any type (2,714 versus 2,596), as well as more prostate cancers (1,437 versus 863), thyroid cancers (73 versus 57), and melanoma (201 versus 131). On the other hand, the results suggested that the FDNY workers would develop significantly fewer (P<0.001) lung (237 versus 373), colorectal (172 versus 267), and kidney (66 versus 132) cancers.

The analysis produced an estimated 20-year cost of first-year cancer treatment of $235,835,412.

""We project that the FDNY-WTCHP cohort will experience a greater cancer burden than would be expected from a demographically similar population,"" Zeig-Owens and co-authors concluded. ""This underscores the importance of cancer prevention efforts and routine screening in WTC-exposed rescue and recovery workers.""

"Action Points Firefighters who responded to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) had a two to three times greater prevalence of multiple myeloma precursor conditions as compared with a control population.

Another WTC study showed a projection that the Fire Department of the City of New York-World Trade Center Health Program cohort will experience a greater cancer burden than would be expected from a demographically similar population.

Firefighters who responded to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) and survived had a two to three times greater prevalence of multiple myeloma precursor conditions as compared with a control population, a long-term follow-up study showed.

The prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) was 1.8 times greater in the firefighters, and light-chain MGUS occurred more than three times as often in the firefighters as in a control group of men without environmental exposure to the WTC.

Additionally, 16 WTC-exposed firefighters had multiple myeloma diagnoses during follow-up to July 2017, 14 of whom had serum or urine for monoclonal protein/light-chain assessment. Seven of the 14 firefighters had light-chain myeloma. The myeloma diagnoses occurred at a median age of 57 -- significantly younger than the median age at diagnosis for the general population of patients with myeloma.

Collectively, the findings suggested that environmental exposure to the WTC disaster site is associated with myeloma precursor disease and may be a risk factor for development of myeloma at an early age, Ola Landgren, MD, PhD, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, and co-authors reported online in JAMA Oncology.

""Taken together, our results show that environmental exposure due to the WTC attacks is associated with myeloma precursor disease ... and may be a risk factor for the development of multiple myeloma at an earlier age, particularly the light-chain subtype.""

Authors of a second report in the same issue of the journal concluded that fire and rescue workers at the WTC site have a significantly higher risk of developing several types of cancer and that the first-year cost of treating the cancers will be $236 million over a 20-year period.

Caveats

The author of an accompanying editorial, however, suggested a need for cautious evaluation and interpretation of the data from the two studies.

""The WTC attack is an emotional subject,"" wrote Otis W. Brawley, MD, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""Cancer is also an emotional subject. There is a tendency to want to blame something for every diagnosed cancer. We often attribute cancer to some environmental exposure. When these WTC heroes are diagnosed as having a cancer, even a cancer common in the population, there is a natural tendency to assume it is due to their service at the WTC.""

Brawley noted that the small number of myeloma cases (16) makes it difficult to establish a firm correlation with WTC service. With regard to the MGUS analyses, a previous study established that firefighters have an increased risk of MGUS and myeloma as compared with the general population. A more appropriate comparison group for the study would have been firefighters from another large city, said Brawley.

Pointing out that ""correlation does not mean causation,"" he mused that ""perhaps this issue is beyond the limits of science.""

The authors of the myeloma/MGUS studies recognized the limitations of their data and agreed with Brawley's caveats, said co-author Amit Verma, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx, N.Y. Nonetheless, the findings inform discussions about the the potential cancer risk faced by firefighters who had exposure to the WTC site.

""The bottom line is that our study shows this increase in MGUS, which is absolutely real, in comparison to a general population,"" Verma told MedPage Today. ""Is it all WTC exposure, or is firefighter exposure also related to this? We cannot answer that in this study.""

The increased risk of specific cancers found in the second study is intriguing, but ""are the predicted increases due to WTC exposure or a career as a firefighter?"" Brawley asked.

MGUS Study

Rescue and recovery workers at the WTC site were exposed to large quantities of potentially carcinogenic substances. Several reports since then have documented modestly elevated rates of cancer among workers at the site. The reports included several case series suggesting an increased incidence of myeloma, especially myeloma with onset at a younger age, among workers at the WTC site. Most new cases of myeloma involve patients age 65 or older, and onset before 50 is uncommon, Landgren and co-authors noted.

In the general population of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, about 80% have disease associated with expression of IgH (monoclonal [M]-protein), and 20% have abnormal light-chain proteins in peripheral blood. Data from a large screening study showed that myeloma associated with IgH and light-chain secretion is preceded by the respective precursor states of MGUS and light-chain MGUS.

The etiology of MGUS and light-chain MGUS remains unclear, but previous studies suggested an association with exposure to known and suspected carcinogens, including substances to which firefighters and search-and-rescue workers were exposed at the WTC site, the authors continued.

To gain insight into the association, Landgren and colleagues studied 16 WTC-exposed white male firefighters who had new diagnoses of myeloma from Sept. 12, 2001 to July 1, 2017. The team also conducted a screening study for myeloma precursor disease in an additional 781 WTC-exposed white male firefighters older than 50, comparing findings with data on a well-studied cohort of men in Olmsted County, Minn.

The investigators used medical records to evaluate the 16 firefighters with myeloma, and obtained serum samples from 1,173 WTC-exposed firefighters. The team excluded samples from men who had myeloma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses before the serum draw, as well as samples from participants younger than 50 or older than 79, leaving a cohort of 781 white, male, WTC-exposed firefighters. The Olmsted County cohort included 7,612 men age 50 to 79.

The Olmsted cohort had an overall MGUS prevalence of 4.4%, with MGUS accounting for 3.4% and light-chain MGUS for 1.0%. The numbers translated into an age-standardized prevalence rate (ASR) of 4.34 per 100 persons. In contrast, the firefighters had an ASR of 7.63 per 100, a 1.8-fold increase versus the Olmsted County reference group. The firefighters had an ASR of 3.08 per 100 for light-chain MGUS, compared with 0.98 for the reference group, a 3.1-fold difference in relative risk.

The ASR for MGUS only was numerically greater among the WTC-exposed firefighters, but the difference did not achieve statistical significance (4.55 versus 3.36 per 100 persons).

"Two major reports warn 9/11 survivors may have a more severe risk of cancers than previously thought – and the chemicals they were exposed to make their diseases more aggressive than usual.

More than 17 years on from the attacks, scores of studies have shown the thousands of men and women who rushed to the scene of the falling Twin Towers have a higher risk of a myriad of conditions, from cancers to PTSD to digestive issues.

But the true scale is only just coming to light as the victims enter middle age, and the rate of diagnoses – and deaths – sky-rocket.

In a new report published today by the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers reveal new data showing that cancer is striking the surviving first-responders 10 to 15 years earlier than it would in the general population.

A second report, also in JAMA, hones in on one particularly alarming disease, the rare blood cancer multiple myeloma, finding its precursor is doubly common in 9/11 survivors compared to the general population, and those who develop myeloma get it 15 years earlier, and a much more aggressive form which is difficult to treat.

The findings are the latest bleak reminders that repercussions of the attack on New York City are still being felt, and will likely claim thousands more lives prematurely in the years to come as scientists race to catch up with the scale of those affected.

‘These figures, you can’t argue with them. There is no discussion to be had,’ said Dr Ola Landgren, author of the myeloma study and top oncologist at of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which sees 20 percent of New York’s myeloma cases.

‘If you just stick to the data and you see they are 10 to 15 years younger than the general population, it’s a more aggressive myeloma, and there is a doubling of the rate of the precursor.

‘Clearly, something is going on. We have learned quite a lot over the last few years about exposures to certain types of chemicals, and we are now more aware of the connection.’

Officially, the World Trade Center Health Registry recognizes 70 cancers as being linked to the toxic cocktail of fumes from Ground Zero, including pulverized concrete, jet fuel and mercury. It also recognizes GERD, every lung disease, sleep apnea, sinusitis, depression, asthma, and PTSD.

Mark Farfel, director of the World Trade Center Health Registry, estimates around 400,000 responders and civilians are at risk of 9/11-related illnesses.

As of 2016, Mount Sinai’s World Trade Center Health Program had counted more than 5,400 people with 9/11-related cancers alone, not counting the other illnesses.

The first of the two reports published today came from the FDNY World Trade Center Health Program, assessing the future costs and scale of cancers among 9/11 responders.

The team, led by Dr Rachel Zeig-Owens, projected new cancer cases over 20 years among a group of 14,474 FDNY rescue and recovery workers exposed to the World Trade Center disaster site.

Estimates suggest 2,960 new cases of cancer (including more prostate, thyroid and melanoma cancers) among these rescue and recovery workers between 2012-2031, which is far higher than would be expected in similar populations with the same social and racial background.

Among white men in the group, 2,714 new cancers were estimated compared with 2,596 in a comparison group.

Dr Zeig-Owens said the stark figures show more, earlier testing needs to be offered for survivors to catch these diseases as early as possible.

The second study backed up this conclusion by honing in on one cancer specifically: multiple myeloma.

The team found the rate of people with the precursor to myeloma among 9/11 responders was double that in the general population – alarming, but offering an opportunity to catch the disease before it develops into myeloma (which is not always the case, but is a high risk).

Dr Landgren explained it is especially important to catch the precursor in 9/11 responders because their forms of multiple myeloma tend to be more aggressive than others’.

Analyzing the two studies in an editorial for JAMA, American Cancer Society doctor Otis Brawley suggested more needs to be done to quantify how much of this increased risk is associated with firefighting in general, which exposes workers to many dangerous toxins on a daily basis.

‘The predicted increases in cancers of the prostate, thyroid, and myeloma are interesting. Excess incidence and mortality for these cancers have been previously reported in firefighters from other cities. Are the predicted increases due to WTC [World Trade Center] exposure or a career as a firefighter?’",health,http://www.infosurhoy.com/cocoon/saii/xhtml/en_GB/health/cancer-hits-9-11-firefighters-earlier-harder-than-first-thought/
"Nearly 17 years after the terror attack, researchers examine World Trade Center environmental factors and cases of multiple myeloma.

BY By Katie Kosko

On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four airplanes on United States soil — two hit the World Trade Center, one the Pentagon and another crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. The terror attack left nearly 3,000 Americans dead and thousands more injured.That day, police officers, firefighters, EMTs, construction workers and volunteers jumped into action trying to rescue and help as many people as they could. In the months after the attack, the cleanup of Ground Zero continued for many rescue and recovery workers.Since then, years of research have linked environmental exposures from the World Trade Center disaster site to health risks, such as cancer — the World Trade Center Health Program lists more than 80 — and lung diseases, as well as mental health concerns like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.Now shedding even more light on cancer risk is a study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Oncology, which shows that these exposures may increase the risk that firefighters who responded on 9/11 will develop early-onset multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), a precursor disease that can lead to the blood cancer.""MGUS is a premalignant condition that typically does not cause symptoms,"" lead author Ola Landgren, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the myeloma service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) in New York City, said in an interview with CURE. ""Therefore, individuals affected will not know they have it, unless they check the blood. Depending on several factors, the individual’s risk of progressing to multiple myeloma varies a lot. The lower end of the spectrum is 1 percent risk per year, while individuals with more developed precursor disease, also referred to as 'smoldering myeloma,' can have 75 percent risk of progressing within less than five years. Some of the most advanced cases have a median time to progression of one to two years.""The study included two parts: a case series that examined firefighters who received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma after September 11 and a screening study that included blood samples collected from World Trade Center-exposed firefighters during routine monitoring examinations.In the cases series, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 16 white male firefighters who were diagnosed with multiple myeloma after 9/11. They determined that the median age at diagnosis was 57 years, which is roughly 12 years younger than that in the national population, noted researchers.In the screening study, blood samples of 781 white male firefighters older than 50 who were exposed to debris from the World Trade Center were analyzed for MGUS or light-chain MGUS in 2016. Researchers compared them with a population of men in Olmsted County, Minnesota, where the population is predominantly white, who had patterns of myeloma precursor disease and were demographically similar. The researchers found a two-fold significantly higher risk of MGUS among the firefighters.""For someone diagnosed with myeloma precursor disease, the current guidelines are that, at the initial visit, additional workup is typically done to rule out multiple myeloma,"" Landgren said. ""This depends on one or several of these: blood and urine tests, imaging and bone marrow biopsy. If negative for multiple myeloma, annual blood tests and clinical monitoring is recommended.""Landgren explained that team members were prompted to study this topic further after they learned that several World Trade Center-exposed firefighters and rescue workers had received new diagnoses of multiple myeloma at MSK.""Our study shows that there is a doubling in the prevalence of myeloma precursor disease among World Trade Center-exposed firefighters compared with the general population,"" he said. ""When we characterize all World Trade Center-exposed firefighters with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, compared with the general population, we found 10 to 15 years earlier age of onset for multiple myeloma. Also, we found markers of more aggressive myeloma biology to be more common in these patients.""However, Otis Brawley, M.D., chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, noted some limitations to the study. ""These trials, because of the size of cohort, cannot identify a small increase in cancer risk due to WTC exposure, and correlation does not mean causation,"" Brawley wrote in commentary simultaneously published with the study.""In noting the differences, one must appreciate that the firefighting profession is documented to be associated with a higher risk of MGUS and multiple myeloma compared with that of the general population,"" he continued. ""This study comparing firefighters with people from a general population tends to show a higher than true relative risk. It would be preferable to compare the World Trade Center-exposed firefighters with an intensively screened age-matched cohort of firefighters from another big city.""To further their research in this area, investigators plan to include more firefighters, expand the age window below 50 years and use a control study of firefighters not exposed to World Trade Center debris, Landgren explained. In addition, he would like to investigate the risk in people who lived or worked near Ground Zero.The World Trade Center Health Program, which was established following the passage of the James Zadroga Act in 2010, works to help monitor and treat those who were directly affected by the 9/11 disaster for related health problems.

"To regain a state of health in the midst of madness, instant pleasures have to be sacrificed in favour of long-term healthy habits, wellness experts say. Striking a balance between work and life is essential to ward off anxiety, stress and depression, says Dr Kanan Khatau. She also spells out the things people can do to de-stress.

Why are psychological illnesses on a rise?

People have lost human touch to technology and have become addicted to gizmos. In the Age of Internet, smartphones and so-called social networks have ruptured and replaced the real-life communication. Students and professionals have become overambitious, but discontent. When the targets people have set are not met, it causes anxiety, depression and stress.

What can people do to avoid anxiety and stress?

We have to spare time for meditation and yoga. Even breathing exercises every hour help to reset the part of brain linked to anxiety and stress. People should also connect to nature more. Watching a sunrise or sunset, walkign along beaches or in parks to relax, and rejuvenating otherwise help one live in the present and improve one’s concentration.

What can be done to avoid medical conditions?

Healthy eating habits and regular exercise, and acquiring a healthy hobby help to fight illnesses like hypertension, diabetes and lifestyle-related ailments. People should invest time nad money in learning techniques to manage stress. Interacting with family, friends, sharing emotional distress, getting involved in community activities bring one out of loneliness and isolation.

However, if people feel they are unable to deal with stress, seeing a counsellor or opting for psychotherapy helps.",health,http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/interview-breathe-walk-stretch-watch-the-sun-rise-dr-kanan-khatau-2609413
"Results From Phase 3 Trial of Migraine Tx Ubrogepant Released

The ACHIEVE II trial included 1355 patients with a history of migraine

Allergan announced results from the second Phase 3 trial for their novel acute migraine treatment, ubrogepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist.

In the ACHIEVE II (UBR-MD-02) trial, 1355 patients with a history of migraine (with or without aura) were randomized (1:1:1) to receive placebo, ubrogepant 25mg or 50mg, respectively, to treat a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe intensity. The co-primary endpoints were pain freedom 2 hours after administration and absence of the most bothersome symptom 2 hours after initial dose.

Results showed that 14.3%, 20.7% (P=.0285), and 21.8% (P=.0129) of patients achieved pain freedom in the placebo, ubrogepant 25mg dose, and 50mg dose groups, respectively. The second co-primary endpoint, absence of most bothersome symptom, was achieved by 27.4%, 34.1% (P=.0711), and 38.9% (P=.0129) of patients in the placebo, ubrogepant 25mg, and 50mg groups, respectively; the ubrogepant 25mg group did not achieve statistical significance for this endpoint.

The 50mg dose was also associated with a statistically significant greater percentage of patients achieving pain relief at 2 hours, sustained pain relief from 2 to 24 hours, and sustained pain freedom from 2 to 24 hours after the initial dose vs placebo (50mg vs placebo, P=.0129 for each endpoints). In addition, a statistically significant greater percentage of patients treated with ubrogepant 50mg achieved absence of photophobia (P=.0167) and phonophobia (P=.0440).

""Given the prevalence of migraine and significant disability that many patients face, ubrogepant may provide a new option for those having tolerability issues with current migraine-specific treatments,"" said Dr. Stephen Silberstein, Director, Headache Center, Thomas Jefferson University.

Additional results from the ACHIEVE II trial will be reported at upcoming scientific meetings.

"Darzalex, a biotech drug known chemically as daratumumab, is already approved in combination with other medicines or alone in patients who had received one or more prior treatment regimens.

By Michael Erman NEW YORK, - Allergan Plc on Friday announced positive results from a second Phase III trial for the 50 milligram dose of its drug for acute migraine, reproducing results from the previous trial.A lower dose of the drug, ubrogepant, failed to meet one of the study's two main goals, the company said.Wall Street is focused on the company's pipeline of drugs in development as Allergan faces new, cheaper competition for its Restasis eye treatment and Namenda XR for Alzheimer's disease. Allergan has said that it believes the migraine drug could reasonably bring in $500 million a year.In February, the drug company reported positive results for the 50 and 100mg doses of the pill in another late-stage trial.This trial backs up those results for the 50mg dose, David Nicholson , Allergan's Chief Research and Development Officer said in an interview.""You have to show that a drug reproducibly demonstrates benefit in the population that you intend to treat. We now have two adequate and well controlled studies clearly demonstrating the benefit of ubrogepant in the acute treatment of migraine,"" Nicholson said.In the trial of more than 1,300 patients, 21.8 percent were pain-free two hours after taking the 50mg dose versus 14.3 percent on placebo. About 39 percent in the 50mg group also reported the absence of their most bothersome symptom (MBS), such as nausea or sensitivity to light or sound, compared with 27.4 percent for placebo. Both results were deemed statistically significant.The 25mg dose, while providing pain relief, was not significantly better than placebo on the MBS measure.The treatment belongs to a class of migraine drugs also being developed by Eli Lilly, Amgen and Alder Biopharmaceuticals that target a protein associated with pain signaling called CGRP.Some of these are injected therapies designed to prevent chronic migraines. Ubrogepant is intended to relieve migraine pain and other symptoms after their onset.Allergan said it is still on track to file for U.S. approval next year, and believes it will be the first oral CGRP on the market. It has two longer-term safety studies to complete this year.There have been some concerns about liver toxicity with drugs in this class. Allergan is confident that its drug does not cause liver problems for patients.""We have no reason to believe that ubrogepant has any propensity to induce liver injury,"" Nicholson said.

"New York, Apr 28 (IANS): Drinking kefir -- a fermented probiotic milk known to help maintain the balance of good bacteria in the digestive system -- can have a positive effect on blood pressure by promoting communication between the gut and brain, a study conducted on rats has found.

After nine weeks of kefir supplementation, the treated rats had lower levels of endotoxins -- toxic substances associated with disruption in the cells --, lower blood pressure and improved intestinal permeability when compared with the untreated group.

In addition, kefir supplementation restored the natural balance of four different bacteria in the gut and of an enzyme in the brain essential for normal nervous system function, suggesting that the nervous and digestive systems work together to reduce hypertension, the results showed.

""Our data suggests that kefir antihypertensive-associated mechanisms involve gut microbiota-brain axis communication during hypertension,"" said the researchers including Mirian Silva-Cutini, of Auburn University in Alabama, US.

The findings will be presented at American Physiological Society's (APS) annual meeting at Experimental Biology 2018 in San Diego.

Previous research has shown that an imbalance in the gut's colony of bacteria (microbiota) may cause high blood pressure in some people.

Similarly, probiotics -- live bacteria supplements that are beneficial to the digestive system -- have been found to lower blood pressure, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear.

After nine weeks of kefir supplementation, the treated rats had lower levels of endotoxins -- toxic substances associated with disruption in the cells --, lower blood pressure and improved intestinal permeability when compared with the untreated group.

In addition, kefir supplementation restored the natural balance of four different bacteria in the gut and of an enzyme in the brain essential for normal nervous system function, suggesting that the nervous and digestive systems work together to reduce hypertension, the results showed.

""Our data suggests that kefir antihypertensive-associated mechanisms involve gut microbiota-brain axis communication during hypertension,"" said the researchers including Mirian Silva-Cutini, of Auburn University in Alabama, US.

The findings will be presented at American Physiological Society's (APS) annual meeting at Experimental Biology 2018 in San Diego.

Previous research has shown that an imbalance in the gut's colony of bacteria (microbiota) may cause high blood pressure in some people.

Similarly, probiotics -- live bacteria supplements that are beneficial to the digestive system -- have been found to lower blood pressure, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear.

"For more than 200,000 years, Neanderthals successfully occupied the cold, dark forests and shores of Europe.

Then early humans came along.

Archaeological evidence suggests that human migrants from Africa arrived on the European continent around 40,000 years ago. About that same time, the Neanderthals all died off.

For decades, anthropologists have puzzled over what factors contributed to this rapid and total replacement of Neanderthals by their modern human cousins.

Now, a multi-disciplinary team including mechanical engineers, neuroscientists and physical anthropologists have provided a new clue to this mystery by creating the first digital reconstruction of four Neanderthal brains.

By comparing these brains with an average human brain, the authors suggest that different ways of processing information may have helped humans outcompete their hominid cousins.

The work was published Thursday in Scientific Reports.

To reconstruct a Neanderthal brain, the authors started by measuring the overall shape of the inside of four Neanderthal skulls.

Next, they created an “average” digital modern human brain and skull by combining MRI data of more than 1,000 modern humans.

Once they had these two measurements, they were able to use a computer program to warp the size and shape of the human brain to match the shape of the interior of the Neanderthals’ skulls in a process called deformation.

This method is not entirely untested. The authors report that the same process has been shown to effectively re-create the structure of a bonobo brain by morphing a chimpanzee brain, and vice versa.

Using this technique, the researchers discovered that while the two types of brains were about the same size, there was a clear difference in shape.

In particular, the authors found that the cerebellum, a region of the brain that lies toward the lower back of our heads, was significantly larger in humans than in Neanderthals.

This part of the brain is associated with speech comprehension and production, working memory and cognitive flexibility, said Naomichi Ogihara, a mechanical engineer at Keio University in Yokohama, Japan, who worked on the study.

And in this region of the brain, size does matter.

The researchers demonstrated this by looking at data on brain size and abilities from 1,095 people that showed a clear relationship between the size of the cerebellum and language comprehension and cognitive flexibility.

The authors propose that because of their relatively small cerebellums, Neanderthals may have been less able to adapt to changes in the environment compared with the early human invaders, giving the humans a tremendous advantage.

However, the team’s reconstructions also suggested Neanderthals did have at least one advantage over early humans. The visual processing center of their brains, known as the occipital lobe, was larger than their human counterparts.

Ogihara said the Neanderthals may have developed this adaptation in response to the low light levels in Europe compared with Africa, but it could have hindered them from expanding the cerebellum.

If that is indeed the case, this volumetric trade-off worked for a very long time — until it didn’t.

Oh, and one more thing: Readers should remember, however, that this attempt to reconstruct the brain inside a fossil skull is new to the field, and perhaps could be improved upon in the future, Ogihara said.

“We would like to further elaborate our methodology by exchanging thoughts and ideas with researchers in the related fields working on human brain evolution,” he said.

He’d also like to use this method to reconstruct the brains of other hominins in the future.",health,https://www.dailyrepublic.com/wires/the-shape-not-size-of-our-ancestors-brains-may-have-helped-them-outlast-neanderthals/

TOKYO, JAPAN—Seeker reports that Naomichi Ogihara of Keio University, Takanori Kochiyama of the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, and Hiroki C. Tanabe of Nagoya University and their colleagues constructed 3-D models of Neanderthal and early Homo sapiens brains using a technique called computational neuroanatomy. The team members based the models on virtual casts of Neanderthal fossil skulls from Israel, France, and Gibraltar and early Homo sapiens from Israel and the Czech Republic; the skull of an early modern human who lived some 30,000 years ago; information collected from MRIs of more than 1,000 living humans; and non-human primate brains. The resulting models indicate that Neanderthal brains were larger than those of modern humans, but they had smaller cerebellums. This region of the brain is associated with language comprehension and production, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. “We are not saying that Neanderthals were incapable of processing languages,” Ogihara said. “We think they could communicate verbally, but their social ability using languages was probably limited because of the brain structural differences.” The scientists also suggest Neanderthals had a larger occipital lobe than early modern humans, perhaps to compensate for low light levels in Europe.

Paris: Scientists have for the first time set eyes on a three-dimensional Neanderthal brain in the form of a virtual model made to fit the empty, fossilised skulls of long-dead individuals, a study said Thursday.

The reconstructed organ confirmed earlier observations, based more loosely on head size and shape, that Neanderthals had a larger brain than their early Homo sapiens cousins, but with a smaller cerebellum — the lower part near the spine that controls balance and movement.

It is also involved in speech and learning.

The distinction may have caused social and cognitive differences between the near relatives, and may explain why one went extinct while the other thrived, said Naomichi Ogihara of the Keio University in Japan, who co-authored a study in the journal Scientific Reports.

“Although the difference could be subtle, such a subtle difference may become significant in terms of natural selection,” he told AFP.

But nothing can be concluded yet about any relation between the Neanderthal’s brain organisation and its eventual demise.

Ogihara and a team combined the disciplines of physical anthropology, mechanical engineering, and neuroscience for their reconstruction.

They used virtual casts to model the shape and size of four fossilised Neanderthal skull cavities, and four of ancient humans.

They then used MRI scans from nearly 1,200 modern-day people to model an “average” human brain, which they “deformed” to fit into the prehistoric skulls.

This allowed the team to estimate what the brains would have looked like, and how individual regions would have differed between the two species.

“We are so far from understanding the brain of prehistoric humans that any small advance is welcome,” French palaeoanthropologist Antoine Balzeau told AFP of the study.

He was not involved in the research.

Neanderthals emerged in Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East some 200,000 years ago. They vanished about 30,000 years ago — coinciding roughly with the arrival of modern humans out of Africa.

The two groups briefly overlapped and interbred, and today, non-African people carry about 1.5-2.1 percent of Neanderthal DNA.

Long portrayed as knuckle-dragging brutes, recent studies have started to paint a picture of Neanderthals as sophisticated beings who made art, took care of the elderly, buried their dead, and may have been the first jewellers — though they were probably also cannibals.

"Johns Hopkins researchers report success with a smart phone video-based app that substitutes for a daily in-person visit by a health care worker required for tuberculosis treatment known as directly observed therapy, or DOT. The preliminary study showed that the app may be less costly and may improve privacy concerns raised by patients compared to in-person visits.

A summary of the study that investigated the app, which provides video Directly Observed Therapy (video DOT), was published on April 26 in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.

“We believe video DOT offers an alternative that appears to be as effective as an in-person daily visits by health care workers to assure compliance with drug treatment, but also empowers patients to manage their TB without added stress,” says Samuel Holzman, M.D., a research fellow in the department of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Tuberculosis is one of the few diseases in the U.S. with state and federal provisions outlining recommended and sometimes required measures to ensure that patients adhere to treatment. These recommendations include provisions for home or hospital based isolation or occasionally forced isolation for infectious individuals. Treatment for tuberculosis is effective and benefits not only the patient, but the public by reducing the chances of ongoing transmission.

The reason for these mandates, says Holzman, is the disease’s virulence. Unlike the flu or the common cold, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes infectious tuberculosis, can hang in the air for extended periods when expelled by the coughs or saliva of patients, spreading to others across a room or through a building’s ventilation. Many people with active TB also have relatively few symptoms, allowing the bacteria to spread before a diagnosis is made.

Tuberculosis is typically treated for six months with a battery of daily antibiotics that include a multidrug combination that can be challenging patients to take. The number of side-effects related to the drugs and the motivation needed to continue the long treatment courses can cause patients to stop their treatment early without appropriate monitoring and strong support. Treatments become even more intensive when caring for multidrug or extensively drug-resistant TB, which require additional antibiotics and can take up to two years to bring under control.

As such, most local health departments in the U.S. require that health care workers observe patients taking their medications to document that they were taken correctly and to monitor for side-effects. In most cases, in-person DOT is conducted five days a week on weekdays and is therefore costly and resource-intensive for local departments of health who absorb the costs associated with treatment.

Nonetheless, this practice helps to support patients through the difficult regimen and provides clinicians a means of tracking a patient’s progress and in-person DOT is the standard of care for TB treatment in the US and globally. However, DOT has the potential to be logistically challenging for patients and is viewed by some patients as stigmatizing or interfering with their autonomy and privacy.

“In an era when we are focused on patient centered care, having to meet a health provider every single day is logistically challenging and can be personally invasive,” says Maunank Shah, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine in the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

To test the effectiveness of video DOT, the researchers conducted a pilot study utilizing the widely-available smartphone application developed by emocha Mobile Health in conjunction with Shah and other clinician-scientists at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

28 adult TB patients being treated at three health departments in Maryland participated in the pilot study. These patients had their therapy monitored using the emocha video DOT application in lieu of in-person visits by a health care worker.

The researchers found that patient adherence to treatment was approximately the same between the video DOT and in-person DOT, 94 percent and 98 percent respectively. As importantly, when including weekends and holidays in the assessment of adherence, the researchers found that the overall proportion of prescribed doses that were verified through observation was 6 percent higher with video DOT compared to in-person DOT.

The researchers also sought to assess the app’s acceptability to patients and clinicians by conducting qualitative interviews and surveys. Ten patients and sixteen staff were interviewed and/or completed surveys after the study. One hundred percent of the patients felt that the emocha platform was ‘easy to use’ and preferred it over in-person DOT. Staff were largely in agreement with these results and 94 percent reported they believed that video DOT was ‘effective for monitoring patient adherence’. The researchers also reported several common themes during in depth interviews that focused on the added convenience and increased flexibility of using video DOT. Another prominent theme was the impression that in-person DOT could risk patient privacy.

The researchers also found that when compared to 5-Day/week in-person visits, video DOT was estimated to cost an average of $674 per patient, compared with $2,065 for in-person DOT. Given potential variability in the costs of software, internet data usage, mobile phones, and other components of video DOT, the researchers estimated the range of costs to implement video DOT at health departments could range from $66 to $1,449 per patient for a standard six month treatment course.

Overall, the investigators found that ninety percent of traditional in-person DOT costs are spent on health worker services. The video DOT costs were mostly in the software, phones and their data plans, with labor accounting for only 20 percent of the cost. In this study, 25 patients (89 percent) elected to use their own devices, leading to potential additional health department cost savings.

Overall, the researchers found that video DOT provides a patient-centered approach to TB treatment monitoring that offers patients improved flexibility and privacy, while allowing health departments the ability to document and support treatment adherence.

A limitation of the study is its small sample size and non-randomization. As such, the researchers say the results may not be applicable to all patients, but they see video DOT as a promising technology for helping TB programs around the world manage TB.

Because the app allows patients to record their doses without a health worker present, the researchers are hopeful that the app may facilitate more medication observation, even on weekends.

MiDOT is one of three video-based technologies that allows for asynchronous recording of patients taking prescribed antibiotic doses. Another is named Aricure that uses artificial intelligence to monitor patients, and another is SureAdhere. Other video DOT technologies listed by the CDC include Face Time, Fuze, HippaBridge, ooVoo, Skype, and Tango.

"""Dark chocolate improves your eyesight,"" is the unusual headline from the Mail Online following a small trial comparing the effects of dark and milk chocolate on vision. The theory is that dark chocolate is high in antioxidant flavanols, which are touted as having many potential health benefits, including effects on the nervous system.

The US study included 30 adults who were given a bar of either dark or milk chocolate and then had their vision tested on a standard chart. The same 30 adults repeated the test 3 days later, eating the alternative bar of chocolate.

Overall, they found that vision was slightly better than normal after eating the dark chocolate: people could read at 20 metres what someone of normal vision could read at only 12 metres (20/12 vision). And after eating milk chocolate, their vision was 20/15 – still better than normal, but not quite as sharp as with dark chocolate.

Whether these minor differences between milk and dark chocolate would make any difference at all in real life, and whether they would be sustained with long-term consumption, is unclear.

There's also the question of whether these findings would be verified in other studies. It could be just a chance finding, given that it was such a small group.

As it stands, there isn't good evidence that dark chocolate will improve your eyesight.

Where does the study come from?

The study was conducted by researchers from University of the Incarnate Word Rosenberg School of Optometry in San Antonio, Texas. No sources of funding are reported and the authors declare no conflict of interest. The study was published in the peer reviewed journal JAMA Ophthalmology and is freely available to access online.

The Mail article reports that 70% of people had improved vision, but only later in the article does it reveal this was a study in 30 people who were tested 2 hours after eating. They also say it ""increases blood flow that sharpens your ability to read numbers and words"", which hasn't been shown here.

What kind of research was this?

This was a randomised crossover trial aiming to investigate whether dark chocolate could have any effects on vison compared with milk chocolate.

The crossover design means that people act as their own controls, receiving one intervention then the other in random order. It's often used to boost numbers for comparison, but this is still a small trial, consisting of only 30 people. It also only looked at immediate effects in the 2 hours following consumption of chocolate, so we certainly can't say that regularly consuming chocolate would improve your vision.

What did the researchers do?

The study recruited 30 healthy adults from Texas, US, who were paid to participate in the study. Two-thirds were women, with an average age of 26 years.

They were randomised to consume either a:

47g bar of dark chocolate (72%) containing 316mg of flavanols

40g crispy rice milk chocolate bar containing 40mg flavanols (8 times fewer flavanols than dark)

Almost 2 hours later they had an eye examination to measure their visual acuity (clarity of vision) on a standard wall chart, scoring the number of letters read correctly on different lines. Their vision was corrected for their latest prescription, so they were allowed to wear their glasses, for example.

After a 72-hour period they repeated the assessment after consuming the other chocolate bar.

Participants had been told the purpose of the study was to assess the possible effects of chocolate on vision, though hadn't been specifically told it was to see if the dark performed better than the milk. Assessors were aware of group assignment.

What were the basic results?

The researchers found that visual acuity was slightly better after eating the dark chocolate compared with eating the milk chocolate. Participants had an average visual acuity of about 20/12 after eating dark chocolate, meaning they read at a distance of 20 metres what a person of normal vision could read at 12 metres. This compared with a score of 20/15 after milk chocolate, which is still better than average but not quite as sharp as with dark chocolate.

Overall, 24 of the 30 participants had shown some improvement to visual acuity scores after eating dark chocolate.

What do the researchers conclude?

The researchers conclude: ""Contrast sensitivity and visual acuity were significantly higher 2 hours after consumption of a dark chocolate bar compared with a milk chocolate bar"" but they do rightly caution that ""the duration of these effects and their influence in real-world performance await further testing.""

Conclusions

This trial is of passing interest but there's little that can be concluded from it.

It's a small sample of adults from Texas. They consumed 2 bars of chocolate on 2 occasions and had their vision tested 2 hours later. Their visual acuity was marginally better after eating dark chocolate, when compared to milk chocolate, but there are limitations to bear in mind.

First, it's possible that this was a chance finding, given that the group was so small. The participants didn't know the exact purpose of the study, so they shouldn't have been ""trying harder"" after the dark bar. But the assessors did know, which allows the possibility that they could have been biasing the results towards the dark and assessing more favourably.

Also, the difference was small, and the participants had better-than-normal vision after eating either bar. They were reading at 20 metres what a person of normal vision could read at 15 after the milk and 12 after the dark. But whether this would translate into any noticeable real-life long-term difference is up for debate.

It is also worth noting these are only immediate effects. It's not known if it would make a real difference if the person were to continue eating dark chocolate on a regular basis.

"Studying the brain benefits of chocolate—cocoa and dark chocolate, mainly—has become a big area in recent years. Numerous studies have suggested that high-potency cacao has significant effects on things like cognition, mood, cholesterol, insulin sensitivity, and blood vessel function. Now, two new studies from Loma Linda University find that some of chocolate’s benefits may also occur at fairly doable doses: A serving or two of dark chocolate may boost memory, cognition, the immune system, and mood.

Both studies were presented this week at the Experimental Biology 2018 annual meeting this week.

For one study, the researchers had healthy participants eat the equivalent of a chocolate bar—48 grams of dark chocolate, which was 70% cacao and 30% organic cane sugar. Then their brains were scanned with EEG, which measures brain waves, 30 minutes and 60 minutes after eating the chocolate. The team reports that gamma waves increased across multiple areas of the cortex, mainly related to cognition and memory; the changes were much more robust at the earlier time point, and largely returned to normal at the later one.

“We suggest that 48 g 70% cacao consumption with a concentration of antioxidant activity…is associated with subsequent [gamma wave] increase in the cerebral cortical brain,” the authors write. “We suggest that this superfood of 70% cacao (organic cocoa beans from Tanzania) enhances neuroplasticity for behavioral and brain health benefits.”

In the second study, participants ate the same variety of chocolate as above, every day for a week. They were asked to abstain from high-antioxidant foods in the days leading up to the study. Their blood was collected every day after they’d eaten the chocolate, so that the researchers could measure the expression of multiple genes.

It turned out that genes involved in the immune response (e.g., white blood cell activation) were boosted, while those involved in inflammation were reduced. The expression of genes involved in neural signaling and sensory perception also increased.

The results might be encouraging for people looking for more evidence to support their predilection for dark chocolate.

“For years, we have looked at the influence of dark chocolate on neurological functions from the standpoint of sugar content - the more sugar, the happier we are,"" said study author Lee Berk in a statement.

Well, this isn’t exactly true, since researchers have been attributing the neurological benefits of cocoa to its polyphenols (antioxidants) for years. Universities have been studying cocoa for a long time, and Mars, Inc. has helped fund studies to quantify the effects of flavanols, and measure their effects on both cognition and the brain. In one Columbia University study, participants who drank a high-potency flavanol drink for three months had improved memory function and changes in a part of the brain linked to age-related memory decline. Other studies have shown similar results on cognition and memory.

But what may be more noteworthy about the new studies is that they suggest it may not take huge amounts of bitter chocolate or super-condensed cocoa to have measurable effects. ""This is the first time that we have looked at the impact of large amounts of cacao in doses as small as a regular-sized chocolate bar in humans over short or long periods of time, and are encouraged by the findings,"" says Berk. “These studies show us that the higher the concentration of cacao, the more positive the impact on cognition, memory, mood, immunity and other beneficial effects.”

The studies were both very small pilot studies, and neither has been published in a peer-review journal, which means that they should be considered preliminary.

But because earlier work has found similar connections, it’s not difficult to imagine that the new studies’ findings are valid. So if you're a fan of dark chocolate, science again suggests you may carry on.",health,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/04/27/dark-chocolate-may-boost-brain-function-immunity-and-mood/

Eating certain types of chocolate has positive effects on stress levels, mood, inflammation, memory and immunity, findings of two new studies have revealed.

The studies, which were presented at the Experimental Biology 2018 annual meeting in San Diego, showed that dark chocolate with a high concentration of cacao is particularly beneficial to health.

Lee Berk, from Loma Linda University, and colleagues who conducted the two studies found that chocolate-influenced gene activity increased infection-fighting cells and anti-inflammatory agents. They also found that these treats can positively impact brain function such as creativity and cognitive functions.

""This is the first time that we have looked at the impact of large amounts of cacao in doses as small as a regular-sized chocolate bar in humans over short or long periods of time, and are encouraged by the findings,"" Berk said.

Berk and colleagues recommended chocolate with a high concentration of cacao: those with a minimum of 70 percent cacao and 30 percent organic cane sugar.

""The higher the concentration of cacao, the more positive the impact on cognition, memory, mood, immunity and other beneficial effects,"" Berk added.

Given the number and variety of chocolates available in the market, there are other things that consumers may want to consider when buying chocolates to ensure they get the healthiest possible treat.

Ingredients

It is best to go for dark chocolate with the fewest ingredients. Some ingredients are added to dark chocolate to improve the flavor, appearance, and shelf life. Some of these are harmless while others may have a negative impact on the quality of the chocolate.

Sugar is usually added to dark chocolate to balance the bitter taste. The rule of thumb is to choose chocolate that does not have the sugar listed first on their list of ingredients. Go for brands that list sugar last. Chocolates with a higher cocoa percentage also tend to have lower sugar content.

High-quality dark chocolate need not have any milk added to it except milk fat. Lecithin is neither required to make dark chocolate.

Alkalized Chocolates

Dutching, a chocolate processing method that involves treatment with alkali, changes the color of the chocolate and reduce the bitter flavor. Studies, however, have shown that Dutching can significantly reduce the amount of the beneficial antioxidants in chocolate. Look for lines like ""cocoa processed with alkali"" when checking chocolate labels.

Organic Chocolates

Choosing organic chocolate may reduce an exposure to pesticides used to spray on the beans and other artificial chemicals.

"A new study looked at the effectiveness of novel risk tool to predict 30-day readmission rates in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This first ever tool calculates a score to help clinicians and medical professionals predict risk of 30-day readmission for TAVR patients and can be easily incorporated in patient electronic medical records (EMR). The study was presented today at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) 2018 Scientific Sessions.

More than five million Americans are diagnosed with heart valve disease each year (AHA). TAVR is a procedure used for intermediate and higher open surgical-risk patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve. In TAVR, a prosthetic valve is implanted percutaneously in the place of the diseased native valve. Patients who undergo TAVR are typically older with higher prohibitive risks and greater number of clinical comorbidities. Nearly 15-20 percent of patients who undergo TAVR - a less invasive procedure to replace the heart's aortic valve - are readmitted within 30 days. Readmissions are costly to patient outcomes and are also associated with more than $40 billion in hospital costs annually.

The study analyzed patients in the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) who underwent TAVR from January 2013 to September 2015. Complex survey methods, hierarchical regression and the 'rms' library were implemented to create a prediction ruler to determine probability for 30-day readmission. The study's researchers performed an internal calibration with bootstrapping.

During the study period, a total of 39,305 patients underwent endovascular TAVR, and 6,380 (16.2 percent) were readmitted within 30 days. The final risk tool included the following variables: chronic kidney disease, end stage renal disease on dialysis, anemia, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, atrial fibrillation, length of stay >5 days, acute kidney injury and discharge disposition. The c-statistic of the model was 0.63. A score of 212 was associated with a more than 30 percent readmission rate.

""The creation of this tool and the results of the study are very assuring because it allows for better understanding how patients should be managed peri-TAVR. By recognizing patients at higher risk of readmission, we can guide post discharge care coordination and improve transitions of care to decrease readmission, improve quality of life, reduce healthcare costs and ultimately impact mortality rates,"" said lead author Sahil Khera, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital.

""Use of the simple risk tool will allow the entire care team to quantify readmission risk and enhance our ability to provide personalized transitional care to hopefully mitigate this risk,"" said co-author Sammy Elmariah, MD, also from the Massachusetts General Hospital.

The authors are looking to start using this tool and incorporating into EMRs in hospital systems across the country in the near future.",health,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20180427/Study-shows-effectiveness-of-novel-risk-tool-to-predict-readmission-rates-after-TAVR.aspx

"SAN DIEGO, APRIL 26, 2018 – A new study examines the effectiveness of 3D printing technology and computer modeling to predict paravalvular leak (PVL) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). A common risk of TAVR is an ill-fitting valve which can lead to PVL. To address this risk, the study used 3D printing technology to help confirm and detect the location of the leak. The retrospective study was presented today at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) Scientific Sessions.

More than five million Americans are diagnosed with heart valve disease each year (AHA). TAVR is a procedure used for intermediate, high-risk, and inoperable patients with severe narrowing of the aortic valve where a prosthetic valve is implanted and the damaged valve is replaced. Patients who undergo TAVR, which is a less invasive procedure to replace the heart’s aortic valve, can experience paravalvular leak around the new valve which can lead to higher mortality rates. Therefore, clinicians are exploring ways to find and prevent these leaks from happening. 3D printing has become more popular within the medical space as it has been discovered to be a vital tool to prevent, fix and foresee procedural errors.

In the study, six patients undergoing TAVR for severe, calcific aortic stenosis and at risk for paravalvular leak had pre-procedure computed tomography (CT) images analyzed and segmented for printing of 3D models. The CT scans allowed researchers to see a 360-degree view of the location of the calcium build up while the 3D models allowed researchers to further evaluate the ill-fitting valves. The 3D aortic root models were then implanted with the valve to determine if the size was correct, ultimately revealing where the calcium composites would be. The 3D models were scanned, evaluated for final analysis and then compared to in-vivo implanted TAVR echocardiograms.

Every leak seen on the 3D models were confirmed on the CT digital scans. The 3D models allowed researchers to use prototypes to personalize valve placement, size and location to stop leaks and lower calcium build up.

“We are very encouraged to see such positive outcomes for the feasibility of 3D printing in patients with heart valve disease. These patients are at a high risk of developing a leak after TAVR, and anything we can do to identify and prevent these leaks from happening is certainly helpful,” said lead author Sergey Gurevich, MD, and Cardiovascular Fellow at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, MN. “Like any other new technology, as 3D printing evolves, we hope to see an increase in accessibility and opportunity for the use of this technology to help improve patient care.”

The authors call for a functional study to help determine the exact size of the leak. The authors of this study are working with computational fluid dynamics to optimize calculations.

Doctors can use 3D printing and computer modeling to predict paravavular leak (PVL) in patients who are undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), according to new research from the University of Minnesota.

One of the common risks associated with TAVR is valves not fitting which can cause PVL. A recent study conducted by cardiovascular fellow Dr. Sergey Gurevich used 3D printing technology to confirm and locate where the leak occurred.

Approximately 25,000 people die every year from under-recognized heart valve disease, according to the American Heart Association. Age, a history of rheumatic fever or infective endocarditis, heart attack, heart failure or previous heart valve conditions from birth increase the risk for developing heart valve disease. More than five million Americans are diagnosed each year with the disease.

The TAVR procedure is used for intermediate, high-risk and inoperable patients who have a server narrowing of the aortic valve where a prosthetic valve was implanted. The damaged valve is replaced in the less invasive procedure, but complications like a paravalvular leak around the new valve can lead to higher mortality rates. Because of these complications, clinicians are looking for ways to find and prevent the leaks.

Six patients who were undergoing TAVR for severe, calcific aortic stenosis participated in the study. They all were at-risk for PVL and had computed tomography images taken and analyzed before the procedure. The images were segmented for the printing of 3D models. CT scans allowed the researchers to view the location of the calcium build up in a 360-degree view to evaluate the poorly fitted valves. 3D aortic root models were implants with the valve to see if it was the correct size while simultaneously seeing where the calcium composites are located.

The 3D models are scanned and evaluated fro a final analysis and compared to in vivo implanted TAVR echocardiograms. All of the leaks that are seen on the 3D models were confirmed on CT digital scans as well. The models allowed researchers to use prototypes to personalize valve placement, size and location to alleviate leaks and reduce calcium build up, according to the researchers.

“We are very encouraged to see such positive outcomes for the feasibility of 3D printing in patients with heart valve disease. These patients are at a high risk of developing a leak after TAVR, and anything we can do to identify and prevent these leaks from happening is certainly helpful,” Gurevich, who was the lead author on the study, said in a press release.

Thanks to researchers from the University at Buffalo’s School of Dental Medicine, dentures might be about to get a whole lot smarter.

Around two-thirds of the U.S. population who wear dentures suffer from regular mouth infections, with symptoms including redness, inflammation, and swelling. Researchers from the University at Buffalo think they have come up with an innovative solution, however — and it can be applied to a range of prostheses and clinical devices.

Using 3D printing, they developed special dentures containing microscopic capsules that are able to carry out a controlled release of antifungal medication. These drugs are diffused to the wearer through a single porous layer. Unlike current denture disinfection treatments, this approach can be carried out while the dentures are being worn.

“3D printing is revolutionizing manufacturing and there has been tremendous progress in various approaches including high resolution, rapid printing techniques, as well as broad range of printable materials — including polymers and metals,” Praveen Arany, assistant professor in the Department of Oral Biology, told Digital Trends. “This project has effectively repurposed routine prosthetic material, methyl methacrylate, for 3D printing. This material is standardly used for making clinical prosthetics, including dentures and artificial joints, that are processed in a lab that involves several laborious and costly steps. The new method described in this work effectively bypasses the need for lab fabrication and can be potentially done in the clinic more rapidly and in a cost-effective manner.”

The researchers on the project think their approach would be useful for creating smart dentures for elderly and disabled patients who are unable to easily clean their own mouthpieces. However, this isn’t just of interest to older folks. Arany said that the same approach could be used to create mouth guards and retainers, bone plates and splints, joint prostheses, and valves and stents that can also release a range of drugs or biological agents for therapy. This might include scenarios such as pain relief, drugs to prevent organ rejection or scarring, and more.

“In followup work, we have been able to address the mechanical strength issue and can now fabricate clinically acceptable prosthesis with properties comparable to routinely manufactured prosthesis,” Arany continued. “Ongoing work is adding significant novel functionalities to enable ‘smart’ — sense and respond — attributes.”

"Almost two-thirds of denture-wearers in the US frequently experience what's known as denture-related stomatitis – fungal infections of the mouth. In order to try and bring that number down, scientists have recently created 3D-printed dentures that release fungus-killing medicine.

Led by Dr. Praveen Arany, a team from the University at Buffalo printed the prototype dentures out of Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA), which is currently the standard denture-making material. For the outer layer of the dentures, that PMMA was mixed with biodegradable microspheres filled with the antifungal medication Amphotericin B. These spheres both protected the medicine from the heat of the printing process, and subsequently allowed it to gradually leak out as they degraded.

In lab tests, the dentures were found to be highly effective at eradicating Candida albicans fungus over a sustained period. When they were strength-tested alongside conventionally-manufactured dentures, they turned out to have 35 percent less flexural strength, although the machine that was bending them never did succeed in actually breaking them. It's possible that their strength could be improved by adding glass fibers and carbon nanotubes to the material.

The scientists also experimented with applying one, five and 10 layers of the microsphere-containing PMMA, although it turned out that more wasn't necessarily better. ""We were trying to test if multiple layers could effectively enable increased dose and longer sustained drug delivery, but this turned out to be incorrect,"" Arany tells us. ""We observed that only the one-surface 3D-printed layer degrades effectively (five and 10 appear to be irreversibly heat fused, 'trapping' the drug).""

With this in mind, he adds that a possible alternative to 3D-printing a set of the dentures from scratch would be to just take a patient's existing dentures, scan them, abrade away their outer layer, and then replace it with a layer of the Amphotericin B-enhanced PMMA. That said, for patients getting their first set of dentures, there would be an advantage to getting them 3D-printed – the build process would only take a matter of hours, as opposed to days or even weeks for traditional dentures. They would also be less expensive.

Arany now hopes that the technology could be applied not only to dentures, but also to fungus-killing splints, stents, casts and prostheses.

A paper on the research was recently published in the journal Materials Today Communications.",health,https://newatlas.com/fungus-killing-dentures/54406/
"Researchers at the University at Buffalo have developed a method to rapidly 3D print dentures that contain an antifungal drug. The dentures can release the drug slowly over time, helping to combat fungal infections before they happen. The technique could also be useful for creating different drug-releasing medical implants, such as stents and prostheses.

Fungal infections, resulting in inflammation and pain in the mouth, affect nearly two thirds of denture wearers in the US. Current treatments include antiseptic mouthwashes and microwave disinfection of dentures. However, these techniques do not help to prevent infections while the dentures are worn during the day.

To address this issue, the Buffalo research team has developed a way to incorporate an antifungal drug directly into the dentures themselves, and couple it with a rapid production technique – 3D printing. The researchers combined microscopic capsules, containing the antifungal drug Amphotericin B with acrylamide, a go-to material for dentures. The microcapsules protect the drug during the printing process, and allow for slow drug release.

The researchers used a 3D printer to make dentures from a microcapsule/acylamide mixture. “The major impact of this innovative 3-D printing system is its potential impact on saving cost and time,” said Praveen Arany, a researcher involved in the study. “The technology allows clinicians to rapidly create customized dentures chair-side, a vast improvement over conventional manufacturing that can vary from a few days to weeks.”

The resulting dentures are not as strong as conventional dentures, but did not fracture during any of the researchers’ tests. Future research will focus on adding additional materials, such as carbon nanotubes, to increase the strength of the dentures.

“The antifungal application could prove invaluable among those highly susceptible to infection, such as the elderly, hospitalized or disabled patients,” said Arany.

See how the dentures are made in the video below.

"Major depression affects around 14 per cent of people worldwide and is the biggest contributor to long-term disability in the general population. (Photo: Pixabay)

London: International scientists have identified 44 genetic variants that can increase the risk of developing major depression and found that all humans carry at least some of them.

The new findings could help explain why not everyone treated with antidepressants sees their condition improve, the scientists said, and could also point the way toward new medicines.

In the largest study of its kind, scientists also found that the genetic basis for depression is shared with other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and that a number of the variants are linked to the targets of antidepressant drugs.

Major depression affects around 14 per cent of people worldwide and is the biggest contributor to long-term disability in the general population. Yet only about half of patients respond well to existing treatments.

“The new genetic variants discovered have the potential to revitalize depression treatment by opening up avenues for the discovery of new and improved therapies,” said Gerome Breen of King’s College London, who worked on the research team.

The study - published on Thursday in the journal Nature Genetics - was a global effort, with data covering more than 135,000 patients with major depression and around 344,000 controls as comparisons.

“This study has shed a bright light on the genetic basis of depression, but it is only the first step,” said Cathryn Lewis, another King’s College London expert who worked on the team.

The PGC began in early 2007 and has rapidly become a collaborative confederation of most investigators in the field. The PGC includes over 800 investigators from 38 countries. There are samples from more than 900,000 individuals currently in analysis, and this number is growing rapidly. The PGC is the largest consortium and the largest biological experiment in the history of psychiatry.

The PGC is passionate about open, inclusive, participatory, and democratic science. Given the importance of the problems we study, we are committed to rapid progress.

From 2007-11, the PGC focused on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BIP), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). We now include large studies of eating disorders (ED), substance use disorders (SUD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)/Tourette's Syndrome (TS), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Initially, the PGC focused on common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Our focus has expanded to include copy number variation (CNV) and uncommon/rare genetic variation.

"A global research has mapped out the genetic basis of major depression, identifying 44 genetic variants which are risk factors for depression, 30 of which are newly discovered. The study, by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and co-led in the UK by King’s College London, is the largest study to-date of genetic risk factors for major depression.

The findings showed that the genetic basis of depression overlaps importantly with other psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The meta-analysis of more than 135,000 people with major depression and more than 344,000 controls has identified 44 genomic variants with links to depression.

Of these 44 loci, 30 are newly discovered while 14 had been identified in previous studies.

In addition, the study identified 153 significant genes and found that major depression shared six loci that are also associated with schizophrenia, the researchers said in a paper published in the journal Nature Genetics.

“This study is a game-changer. Figuring out the genetic basis of major depression has been really hard. With more work, we should be able to develop tools important for treatment and even prevention of major depression,” said Patrick F. Sullivan, Professor at the University of North Carolina in the US.

Intriguingly, the genetic basis of depressive disorder also overlaps with that for obesity and multiple measures of sleep quality, including daytime sleepiness, insomnia and tiredness.

While all people carry genetic variants for depression, but those with a higher burden are more susceptible, the study showed.

“We know that many life experiences also contribute to risk of depression, but identifying the genetic factors opens new doors for research into the biological drivers,” added Naomi Wray, from the University of Queensland in Australia.

The National Institute of Mental Health deem major depression ""one of the most common mental disorders in the United States.""

Around 16.2 million adults had ""at least one"" episode of major depression in 2016 alone.

Depression has many risk factors — biological, environmental, and of a psychological nature — and often it is a combination of these that leads to the development of the condition.

Of the biological factors, inherited genetic variations are often cited, though researchers have had a hard time in pinpointing which genetic locations in our DNA are specifically linked with a higher risk of depression.

But a large-scale new study has gone where no others have gone before and identified dozens of previously unknown genetic variations that constitute a risk factor for major depression.

The researchers involved in the study — including Dr. Patrick F. Sullivan, at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill — note that studies of the human genome focused on risk factors for depression face many obstacles.

In their paper, which is published in the journal Nature Genetics, they write:

""There are many reasons why identifying causal loci for [major depressive disorder] has proven difficult. [Major depressive disorder] is probably influenced by many genetic loci, each with small effects, as are most common diseases, including psychiatric disorders.""

Study charts complex genetic risk factors

The researchers managed to access and analyze seven different sets of genetic data, including some sourced from the controversial DIY genetic testing company 23andMe.

These were collected from 135,458 individuals diagnosed with major depression, and 344,901 depression-free controls.

This analysis revealed 44 different genetic variants with a statistically significant impact on individuals' development of major depression.

Of these, 14 had already been linked to depression, but the remaining 30 were previously unknown as risk factors. Moreover, the researchers pinpointed 153 genes that they deemed relevant to the risk of depression.

In terms of risk factor overlaps, the team also found that six of the genetic variants that correlated with a higher risk for depression were at the same time associated with a heightened risk for another psychiatric disorder: schizophrenia.

""This study is a game-changer,"" Dr. Sullivan explains, continuing, ""Figuring out the genetic basis of major depression has been really hard.""

""A huge number of researchers across the world collaborated to make this paper,"" he says, ""and we now have a deeper look than ever before into the basis of this awful and impairing human malady.""

'New doors opened' for further research

The researchers are well aware that, for depression to take hold, several factors must be present. For example, traumatic life experiences act as a ""fertilizer,"" or a catalyst, for this condition, and it would not be able to take root easily in the absence of a welcoming ""soil.""

In the case of depression, this soil might be a combination of genetic variations that make a person a lot more susceptible to the disorder.

""We show that we all carry genetic variants for depression, but those with a higher burden are more susceptible,"" says study co-author Naomi Wray, from the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.

She continues, ""We know that many life experiences also contribute to risk of depression, but identifying the genetic factors opens new doors for research into the biological drivers.""

The researchers hope that their new findings will spur further studies to develop better treatments targeting the genetic factors involved in depression.

""With more work, we should be able to develop tools important for treatment and even prevention of major depression,"" says Dr. Sullivan.",health,https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321652.php

"A 200-strong team of researchers from across the globe have mapped the genetic variants that increase the risk of depression

Scientists have raised hopes for more effective treatments for depression, a condition that affects over 300 million people globally, after mapping out the genetic foundations of the mental disorder in unprecedented detail.



In the world’s largest investigation into the impact of DNA on the mental disorder, more than 200 researchers identified 44 gene variants that raise the risk of depression. Of those, 30 have never been connected to the condition before.

By tripling the number of gene regions linked to depression, scientists now hope to understand more about why the disorder strikes some but not others, even when they have similar life experiences. The work could also help in the search for drugs to treat the condition which affects as many as one in four people over a lifetime.

“If you have a lower genetic burden of depression, perhaps you are more resistant to the stresses we all experience in life,” said Cathryn Lewis, professor of statistical genetics and a senior author on the study at King’s College London.

Previous work with twins suggests that genetics explains about 40% of depression, with the rest being driven by other biological factors and life experiences. If people are ranked according to the number of genetic risk factors for depression they carry, those in the top 10% are two-and-a-half times more likely to experience depression than those in the bottom 10%, Lewis said.

While the scientists found 44 gene variants linked to depression, these are only a small fraction of the total, because many more will have had too small an effect to be discovered in the latest study. “We know that thousands of genes are involved in depression with each having a very modest effect on a person’s risk,” said Lewis. “There is certainly no single gene for depression.”

Clinical depression is a debilitating condition the causes of which are still largely unknown. According to the World Health Organization, it is the leading cause of disability globally, costing the global economy as much as $1tn annually with no country on the planet immune.

Sufferers can experience a range of “losses” – of appetite, mood, sleep, concentration, love, joy, enthusiasm, energy and serenity. As many as 3% of people with major depressive disorder attempt suicide.

But there are few new treatments in the pipeline, as big pharmaceuticals companies have largely withdrawn from expensive research into the next generation of anti-depressants.

In the study, the researchers pooled seven separate datasets from the UK, the US, Iceland and Denmark, to glean genetic information on 135,000 people who reported having depression, and 345,000 mentally healthy individuals. The scientists then compared DNA across the groups to find gene variants that were more common in those with depression.

The work, published in Nature Genetics, revealed a substantial overlap in the genetics that underpins depression and other mental disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but also body mass index, where DNA that predisposes people to obesity also raises the risk of depression.

As expected, many of the genes reported in the study have a role in how neurons grow, operate and send signals around the brain, where two regions known as the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex are the most important for depression.

Gerome Breen, a co-author on the paper, said that some of the gene variants they found are linked to neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which existing antidepressants work on. But other gene variants point to new biological mechanisms that the next generation of drugs might target.

“What we’ve had in recent decades is a shortage of new mechanisms that underlie depression and psychiatric disorders,” he said. “The hope is that in new data we identify new processes that can be targeted by newly developed types of drugs, which have different mechanisms of action to existing medications.”

It will take more research to confirm that the gene variants found in the study are really linked to depression. Many of the participants involved in the research self-reported depression, which is far less reliable than a clinical diagnosis. This means that some of the gene variants the scientists link to depression could turn out not to be involved in the disorder.

Jonathan Flint, who studies the genetics of depression at the University of California in Los Angeles said: “Our current treatments for depression are relatively ineffective – roughly speaking, only about half of patients improve – so we really need better therapies. To discover new treatments and to deliver the ones we have more effectively, we need a better understanding of what causes depression. Finding genetic risk variants is a way to do just that – the risk variants point to genes that are involved in the disease, and thus provide clues to how depression arises.”",health,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/26/gene-map-for-depression-sparks-hopes-of-new-generation-of-treatments

"A new Canadian study finds that doctors may have spent years underestimating the number of children with high blood pressure, missing kids who could have benefited from early intervention.

In August 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics unveiled a more restrictive definition of “high blood pressure” for children. It also created a much-simplified chart to help physicians quickly decide whether a child’s blood pressure is within the normal range.

Although children with high blood pressure often don’t notice the health effects, untreated high blood pressure can damage the kidneys and cause long-term damage to blood vessels that can lead to early heart attacks or strokes.

In the new study published this week in JAMA Pediatrics, Canadian researchers looked at how the revised hypertension definition would impact a sample of children.

They looked at the blood pressure readings of more than 15,000 generally healthy U.S. children between the ages of aged 5 and 18 who took part in an ongoing long-term health study between 1999 and 2014.

The researchers found that 5.8 per cent, or 905 of the children, should either have been classified with hypertension, or be reclassified into a higher risk category.

Children with high blood pressure were more likely to be overweight or obese, have high cholesterol, and indicators of prediabetes.

Lead researcher Dr. Celia Rodd, with the Children’s Hospital Research Institute of Manitoba, says her team’s findings suggest that many children’s heart health risk may have been underestimated.

She says it’s important to diagnose high blood pressure early, both to spot acute kidney problems and to take steps to prevent long-term heart problems.

“That doesn’t necessarily mean medications,” Rodd told CTV Winnipeg. “It can mean healthy lifestyle, exercising regularly, watching weight and portions, and healthy eating.”

"Built by Airbus Defence and Space just north of London in Stevenage, Britain’s unlikely “Space City”, the so-called Structural Thermal Model is being packed off to Toulouse, France, for a raft of tests to ensure the real ExoMars rover handles anything the red planet can throw at it.

The European Space Agency’s mission to search for life on Mars has reached an important milestone with its six-wheeled surface rover prototype ready for its “shake and bake”.

Built by Airbus Defence and Space just north of London in Stevenage, Britain’s unlikely “Space City”, the so-called Structural Thermal Model is being packed off to Toulouse, France, for a raft of tests to ensure the real ExoMars rover handles anything the red planet can throw at it.

If the 2020 mission goes to plan it would be Europe’s first rover on Mars, following several successful NASA landings.

Europe’s last attempt to land a rover vehicle on the surface of Mars ended in disappointment in 2016 when Schiaparelli span out of control and slammed into the red sand.

The ESA rover will be more sophisticated though, featuring a two-meter exploration drill and an autonomous navigation system.

“That’s the most exciting thing that hasn’t been done before, we’ve got a huge two meter drill so it can go into the crust which is where we think life would be if it was still surviving,” ExoMars Delivery Manager Abbie Hutty told Reuters.

“At the surface the radiation is extreme and conditions too hostile. Down below different layers of rock, maybe in a fissure where there may be water deposits could be a nice place for life to still be surviving.”

Hutty will keep a close eye on the prototype tests in Toulouse where the launch from a Russian rocket will be simulated as well as the massive temperature variations it will endure 54 million km away on Mars.

Data sent back from the ESA’s Mars Express satellite are helping scientists choose the most suitable landing site.

The ExoMars Rover’s autonomous navigation, which will enable it to steer itself rather than wait 24 minutes for instructions from Earth, has been undergoing testing at Airbus’s Mars Yard.

The Stevenage center has a mock-up of the planet’s surface complete with specially dried sand, boulders and Mars-like light intensity, if not the radiation.

Its six “wafer wheels” made of thin strips of metal and unique suspension system means it can scale rocks and roll across the sandy landscape.

“The cool thing about the wheels is that they are fully metallic and give us the traction and grip of a rubber wheel without taking anything organic from earth. They will be able climb over rocks and also dig through deep sand,” Hutty said.

Once testing is completed in France, work will begin on building the finished rover as well as a twin that will stay in Stevenage.",tech,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/science/science/280418/exomars-rover-prepares-for-shake-down-ahead-of-mars-trip.html

"ExoMars returns first images from new orbit

ExoMars images Korolev Crater

The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has returned the first images of the Red Planet from its new orbit.

The spacecraft arrived in a near-circular 400 km altitude orbit a few weeks ago ahead of its primary goal to seek out gases that may be linked to active geological or biological activity on Mars.

The orbiter’s Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System, CaSSIS, took this stunning image, which features part of an impact crater, during the instrument’s test period. The camera was activated on 20 March and was tested for the start of its main mission on 28 April.

“We transmitted new software to the instrument at the start of the test phase and after a couple of minor issues, the instrument is in good health and ready to work,” says the camera’s principal investigator, Nicolas Thomas from the University of Bern in Switzerland.

The image captures a 40 km-long segment of Korolev Crater located high in the northern hemisphere. The bright material on the rim of the crater is ice.

“We were really pleased to see how good this picture was given the lighting conditions,” says Antoine Pommerol, a member of the CaSSIS science team working on the calibration of the data. “It shows that CaSSIS can make a major contribution to studies of the carbon dioxide and water cycles on Mars.”

The image is assembled from three images in different colours that were taken almost simultaneously on 15 April.

“We aim to fully automate the image production process,” says Nick. “Once we achieve this, we can distribute the data quickly to the science community for analysis.”

The team also plans to make regular public releases.

The orbiter’s camera is one of four instruments on the Trace Gas Orbiter, or TGO, which also hosts two spectrometer suites and a neutron detector.

The spectrometers began their science mission on 21 April with the spacecraft taking its first ‘sniff’ of the atmosphere. In reality, the sniffing is the spectrometers looking at how molecules in the atmosphere absorb sunlight: each has a unique fingerprint that reveals its chemical composition.

A long period of data collection will be needed to bring out the details, especially for particularly rare – or not even yet discovered – ingredients in the atmosphere. Trace gases, as hinted at from their name, are only present in very small amounts: that is, less than one percent of the volume of the planet’s atmosphere. In particular, the orbiter will seek evidence of methane and other gases that could be signatures of active biological or geological activity.

The camera will eventually help characterise features on the surface that may be related to trace gas sources.

“We are excited to finally be starting collecting data at Mars with this phenomenal spacecraft,” says Håkan Svedhem, ESA’s TGO project scientist. “The test images we have seen so far certainly set the bar high.”",tech,http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars/ExoMars_returns_first_images_from_new_orbit
"The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter has released the first images from its new orbit, taken on April 15 from 400 kilometers above the Martian surface. Here’s the uncropped composite image:



The image reveals 40 kilometers of dust, dirt, and ice (seen in white) along the Korolev impact crater in the planet’s Northern Hemisphere, according to a European Space Agency release. The orbiter is part of the ExoMars program, a collaboration between ESA and the Russian space agency, Roscocmos

The Trace Gas Orbiter might be taking some incredible images, but it’s doing a lot more than that. The spacecraft has four instruments: the camera, two spectrometers, and a neutron detector. Its purpose is to understand the Martian atmosphere.

The craft has been orbiting Mars since October 2016, but it only recently arrived in the proper orbit to begin performing its science. It seeks to understand the gas in the Martian atmosphere—methane gas, in particular. Methane has been linked to both biological and geological processes, so scientists want to learn about it got there.

As Nature reports, the methane probably shouldn’t even be there, since chemical reactions in the planet’s atmosphere should destroy it. That means that some process could be putting the methane back in.

So, the Trace Gas Orbiter’s job is more than just supplying us content-hungry internet users with amazing pictures. By mapping the methane, it’s going to provide hints of whether there are some other yet-to-be-understood processes occurring on the Martian surface. The photos will aid in spotting the source of the methane. More experiments are on their way, too, including NASA’s Insight Rover slated to launch next week, and the ExoMars Martian Rover planned for 2021.

Amazing pictures are always welcome, of course.",tech,https://gizmodo.com/gorgeous-photo-of-martian-landscape-is-just-the-beginni-1825600050
"The European Space Agency’s fancy new Mars orbiter only arrived at the Red Planet a few weeks ago, but it’s already delivering some really fantastic eye candy of the Martian surface. The Trace Gas Orbiter (or TGO for short) is currently orbiting the planet at an altitude of just 250 miles, which means it has a great view of the planet’s surface, and it’s just delivered its very first photo to its handlers back on Earth.

The photo shows the frosty edges of the Korolev Crater on the north of Mars. The image was captured using the Color & Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) tool, and while this first photo was merely a test of the system to ensure that it’s functioning properly, it’s already generating a lot of excitement amongst researchers.

“We were really pleased to see how good this picture was given the lighting conditions,” Antoine Pommerol, a member of the CaSSIS science team, explained in a statement. “It shows that CaSSIS can make a major contribution to studies of the carbon dioxide and water cycles on Mars.”

The full image is much larger than the one you see above, and it’s incredibly long and narrow. You can check out the full resolution here, but the icy crater is obviously the star of this particular shot.

But the TGO’s primary mission isn’t to take pictures; ESA equipped the spacecraft with some advanced sensors including two spectrometer systems and a “neutron detector,” all of which will help researchers get a better idea of what the Martian atmosphere is made of. The systems are designed to detect the chemical makeup of the gasses that surround the barren planet, and scientists hope it may even detect something like methane, which could hint that biological processes are active, or were active, on or within the planet.

The Trace Gas Orbiter has a long road ahead of it, with a total planned mission of roughly seven years. Its roughly two-year journey to Mars was a success, and now the real fun for scientists begins. You can expect to hear a lot more about its findings in the coming months and years.",tech,http://bgr.com/2018/04/27/trace-gas-orbiter-photo-mars-surface-esa/
"The Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) has been designed by an international team under guidance of the University of Bern. The Mars camera is on board of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, a European Space Agency/Roscosmos mission. It has now returned its first colour images from the orbit at Mars. The camera system was switched on 20 March and has been undergoing tests in preparation for the start of its prime mission on April 28, 2018.

Replacing the software from afar

""We have had a couple of minor software issues in the initial test phase"", says Principal Investigator, Nicolas Thomas from the Center of Space and Habitability (CSH), University of Bern in Switzerland, ""but the instrument is actually in good health and ready to work.""

The UniBern team transmitted a completely new software version to the instrument at the start of test phase. ""It is amazing that you can totally change the software in an instrument flying around Mars more than 100 million kilometres away and that it works"", says Thomas.

Some of the first images have been spectacular. The example image is from the rim of an ice-filled crater called Korolev at high latitude in the northern hemisphere. The bright material is ice that can be seen on the rim of the crater (which is much larger than the image). The picture has a resolution of just over 5 metres and outperforms the resolution of images from Hubble and other telescopes by far. In the future, CaSSIS should operate from slightly lower altitudes to give resolutions of less than 5 metres.

""We were really pleased to see how good this picture was given the lighting conditions"", says Antoine Pommerol, a member of the CaSSIS science team at the CSH working on the calibration of the data. ""It shows that CaSSIS can make a major contribution to studies of Mars’s carbon dioxide and water cycles.""

The image is a composite of three images in different colours that were taken almost simultaneously by CaSSIS on April 15, 2018. They were then assembled to produce this colour view.

""Our aim is to fully automate the image production process"", says Thomas. ""Once we achieve this, we can distribute the data to the community quickly for analysis.""

Observing dynamics on Mars

CaSSIS is designed to complement the data acquired by the other payload on TGO and other Mars orbiters while also enhancing our knowledge of the surface of Mars. It is now known that Mars is more dynamic than previously thought. Of particular interest to the 25-strong science team from 9 countries (incl. US and Russia) is the chance CaSSIS offers to study changes that occur over the day and over the Martian seasons. Further studies of recently discovered liquid water on the surface will be one of the main aims.",tech,http://www.unibe.ch/news/media_news/media_relations_e/media_releases/2018/media_releases_2018/bernese_mars_camera_cassis_sends_first_colour_images_from_mars/index_eng.html
"For more than a year, a 3.5-tonne spacecraft has been circling Mars in a series of erratic loops. Now, after 1,000 circuits, the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) has reached the ideal position to study the planet’s atmosphere, and has made its first scientific observations. It is poised to solve one of the most controversial mysteries in Martian science: why methane, a possible signature of life, is being released on the red planet.

The TGO is part of the ExoMars mission, a joint venture between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos. The orbiter, which launched in March 2016 and reached the planet that October, is the first craft specifically designed to study gases that make up less than 1% of the planet’s cold, arid atmosphere, including methane, water vapour and ozone. The TGO reached its planned circular orbit earlier this month, and underwent a series of engineering tests before starting to take scientific data on 21 April.

The Martian atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, but researchers are particularly interested in its other components—especially methane. These trace gases could be signals of biological or geological activity, and they provide clues to the planet’s climatic history.

Gas source

Scientists have been catching hints of methane in the Martian atmosphere for 15 years using Earth-based telescopes, Mars orbiters and NASA’s Curiosity rover. As evidence of the gas has accumulated, the debate over its origin has intensified. “Nearly 95% of all the methane in the Earth’s atmosphere originated from current and past biology,” says Sushil Atreya, a planetary scientist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. “So, it is natural to ask whether methane on Mars is also of biologic origin.”

The gas’s presence on Mars has surprised researchers, because chemical reactions in the atmosphere should destroy any methane molecules there within a few centuries. A measurable methane level suggests that an active source must be replenishing the gas.

Curiosity now routinely detects a background level averaging 0.5 parts per billion (p.p.b.) of methane in the atmosphere (by contrast, Earth’s level is about 1,875 p.p.b.). But the Martian concentration changes unexpectedly over time, says Atreya. Observations have also suggested the presence of large plumes with concentrations of 45 p.p.b., and Curiosity has detected burps of around 7 p.p.b. that dissipate quickly. “We didn’t expect methane to be on Mars, and it shouldn’t be variable unless there is an active source and a vigorous sink,” says Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

Researchers have suggested several possible sources. The peaks might come from subsurface chemical reactions between rocks and water, carbon-rich meteorites that enter the atmosphere, or from sudden releases from reservoirs beneath Mars’ surface. Most thrilling of all, the peaks could have a biological origin. “It’s really a mystery,” says Ehlmann.

Scientific payload

The TGO carries four major scientific instruments that will collect data to create global maps of the trace gases, showing in unprecedented detail how their presence varies around the planet and over time.

The orbiter’s main spectrometer, NOMAD, operates in the infrared, ultraviolet and visible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. It will be able to look down from the craft’s orbital altitude through the atmosphere to the surface, a distance of about 400 kilometres. And twice per orbit, when the TGO is on the boundary between Mars’s light and dark sides, NOMAD will be able to peer through the planet’s atmosphere and look towards the Sun. This position increases sensitivity by allowing the probe to look through a much bigger segment of atmosphere—“up to 30 times higher than looking down at the surface”, says Michael Mumma, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is a co-investigator on NOMAD. Researchers should be able to use the data it collects to identify the spectral signatures of various gases, which absorb light at different wavelengths.

The craft’s colour camera, CaSSIS, will build detailed 3D maps of the planet’s terrain. And if other instruments pinpoint a spike in methane concentration, researchers will be able to look through CaSSIS’s archive for images taken at roughly the same time, to try to identify possible sources on the Martian surface. “We’re looking for things like an impact crater or a rock slide or landfall, or a big crack in the ground—that would be really nice,” says Manish Patel, a planetary scientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, who works on NOMAD and CaSSIS.

And data on how ratios of hydrogen and its heavier cousin, deuterium, vary in water by altitude and season will be crucial for understanding the history of water on Mars, says Ehlmann. Mumma hopes that this information will help to illuminate what might have happened to a hypothesized ancient water ocean on Mars—for instance, whether the water evaporated and escaped from the atmosphere.

The next major step, says Patel, is to find out whether the instruments’ sensitivity is as hoped. The TGO is designed to detect trace-gas concentrations down to at least 1 p.p.b. and methane down to 0.02 p.p.b., says Håkan Svedhem, ESA’s ExoMars TGO project scientist at the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. But the sensitivity, which the team should know within the next month, will ultimately depend on factors such as temperature and dust levels in the atmosphere. “It’s a very nerve-wracking time for the team—it’s the culmination of eight or nine years’ work,” says Patel. ESA plans to run the TGO’s science missions until the end of 2020, and the craft will then act as a data-relay station for the agency’s planned ExoMars rover, which should arrive in 2021.

In the first few months, Patel expects to be able to map out levels of methane and start providing the clues that researchers have craved. “The debate over all of this that’s been going on for over a decade—it should answer that question,” he says.

"A new analysis finds that NASA will pay significantly more for commercial cargo delivery to the International Space Station in the 2020s rather than enjoying cost savings from maturing systems. According to a report by the space agency’s inspector general, Paul Martin, NASA will likely pay $400 million more for its second round of delivery contracts from 2020 to 2024 even though the agency will be moving six fewer tons of cargo. On a cost per kilogram basis, this represents a 14-percent increase.

One of the main reasons for this increase, the report says, is a 50-percent increase in prices from SpaceX, which has thus far flown the bulk of missions for NASA’s commercial cargo program with its Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket.

This is somewhat surprising because, during the first round of supply missions, which began in 2012, SpaceX had substantially lower costs than NASA’s other partner, Orbital ATK. SpaceX and Orbital ATK are expected to fly 31 supply missions between 2012 and 2020, the first phase of the supply contract. Of those, the new report states, SpaceX is scheduled to complete 20 flights at an average cost of $152.1 million per mission. Orbital ATK is scheduled to complete 11 missions at an average cost of $262.6 million per mission.

Higher prices

But that cost differential will largely evaporate in the second round of cargo supply contracts. For flights from 2020 to 2024, SpaceX will increase its price while Orbital ATK cuts its own by 15 percent. The new report provides unprecedented public detail about the second phase of commercial resupply contracts, known as CRS-2, which NASA awarded in a competitively bid process in 2016. SpaceX and Orbital ATK again won contracts (for a minimum of six flights), along with a new provider, Sierra Nevada Corp. and its Dream Chaser vehicle. Bids by Boeing and Lockheed Martin were not accepted.

The inspector general found that the higher costs for the CRS-2 contracts—$71,800 per kg versus $63,200 during the first round—were driven by three factors: higher prices from SpaceX, NASA’s decision to have three companies participate in the program instead of two, and the integration costs of berthing and docking the three different spacecraft to the International Space Station.

For these extra costs, NASA will be getting more capability, including greater capacity for pressurized cargo. This should reduce the overall number of flights and accordingly reduce the time required by astronauts to capture, load, and unload cargo resupply spacecraft. The space agency will also have three providers instead of two, which will offer increased flexibility in case one of the three providers has an accident or other problem that delays its ability to fly.

SpaceX rationale

The inspector general cited a number of reasons for SpaceX's 50-percent price increase per kg, including an upgrade to the company's second generation of Dragon spacecraft that increased the cargo volume by 30 percent, longer duration missions, and quicker access to the Dragon 2 spacecraft after it returns science samples to Earth.

Perhaps most tellingly, the inspector general’s report notes the following about SpaceX’s reasoning: “They also indicated that their CRS-2 pricing reflected a better understanding of the costs involved after several years of experience with cargo resupply missions.” This suggests the company either under-bid on the first round of supply contracts or failed to achieve some of the cost savings it had hoped to achieve. (The company declined comment to Ars).

Even so, the report is not all bad news for SpaceX. In comparing prices, the inspector general said that SpaceX should receive credit for the capacity to return cargo to Earth, a capability that Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft does not have. The company, along with NASA, was also credited with lowering costs in the overall launch market by pushing through development of the Falcon 9 rocket.

“Officials believe competition has contributed to lower prices for NASA launches,” the report states. “NASA officials reviewed past launch pricing and found the cost for a basic Atlas V configuration decreased by roughly $20 million per launch after the Falcon 9 became eligible in 2013 to compete for launch services contracts through the Agency’s Launch Services Program.”",tech,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/04/nasa-to-pay-more-for-less-cargo-delivery-to-the-space-station/

The space agency will also have three providers instead of two, which will offer increased flexibility in case one of the three providers has an accident or other problem that delays its ability to fly.

SpaceX rationale

The inspector general cited a number of reasons for SpaceX's 50-percent price increase per kg, including an upgrade to the company's second generation of Dragon spacecraft that increased the cargo volume by 30 percent, longer duration missions, and quicker access to the Dragon 2 spacecraft after it returns science samples to Earth.

Perhaps most tellingly, the inspector general’s report notes the following about SpaceX’s reasoning: “They also indicated that their CRS-2 pricing reflected a better understanding of the costs involved after several years of experience with cargo resupply missions.” This suggests the company either under-bid on the first round of supply contracts or failed to achieve some of the cost savings it had hoped to achieve. (The company declined comment to Ars).

Even so, the report is not all bad news for SpaceX. In comparing prices, the inspector general said that SpaceX should receive credit for the capacity to return cargo to Earth, a capability that Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft does not have. The company, along with NASA, was also credited with lowering costs in the overall launch market by pushing through development of the Falcon 9 rocket.

“Officials believe competition has contributed to lower prices for NASA launches,” the report states. “NASA officials reviewed past launch pricing and found the cost for a basic Atlas V configuration decreased by roughly $20 million per launch after the Falcon 9 became eligible in 2013 to compete for launch services contracts through the Agency’s Launch Services Program.”",tech,https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/04/nasa-to-pay-more-for-less-cargo-delivery-to-the-space-station/
"The US space agency NASA is going to pay more money even if the cargo resupply to the International Space Station is less. As per the reports, under a set of follow-on commercial cargo contracts that were awarded in 2016, NASA will have to pay more cash for less cargo.

According to NASA’s office of inspector general, the amount of money that will be given to three private space agencies namely SpaceX, Orbital ATK and Sierra Nevada for cargo resupply mission to ISS starting in 2019, will be twice of what it paid under the first round of CRS Commercial Resupply Services (CRS-1) awards. A recent audit by IOG revealed that NASA is facing issues with the three space companies that got the CRS 2 contracts for cargo resupply to ISS.

NASA’s inspector general, Paul Martin informed that NASA will have to pay around $400 million more for its CRS 2 contracts starting from the year 2020 to 2024 even if it will be delivering around six ton less cargo. In 2012, NASA gave the contract to SpaceX and Orbital ATK to fly 31 resupply missions to ISS between 2012 and 2020, in which an estimated 93,800 kilograms of cargo needed to be delivered. The total cost of CRS 1 contract was $ 5.93 billion. Now under the new CRS 2 contract, both SpaceX and Orbital ATK, along with a new provider, Sierra Nevada Corp will have to supply 87,900 kilograms of cargo to the space station on 21 missions for an estimated cost of $6.31 billion. This indicates that NASA will have pay more for less cargo resupply under CRS contracts. On a cost per kilogram basis, upcoming CRS 2 mission will cost NASA 14 percent more than its ongoing CRS 1 contracts.

The IOG informed that there are three main reasons behind this high cost of CRS 2 contracts. First is that SpaceX, NASA’s main cargo resupply provider to ISS, has increased is resupply mission to 50 percent. Second is, instead of two, NASA has given contracts to three space companies for the CRS 2 program. The third reason behind the price hike is the increase in the integration costs due to berthing and docking of three different spacecraft on the ISS. But the good thing is that, with three companies set for resupply mission, NASA can send cargo more cargo to ISS in less time and that to be at regular intervals without any interruption.",tech,https://tecake.in/nasa-will-pay-money-less-cargo-resupply-international-space-station
"NASA upgrading ground stations used for emergency ISS communications

Derek Richardson

NASA is currently upgrading ground stations utilized in the backup system for communicating with the International Space Station (ISS), the U.S. space agency said in an April 24, 2018, news release.

The primary means of communicating with the ISS is NASA’s Space Network, which mainly relies on a constellation of Tracking and Data Relay Satellites in geostationary orbit. As a backup, the agency also maintains a system of ground stations that transmit and receive very high frequency (VHF) radio waves. In particular, the system uses two frequencies—VHF1 and VHF2.

According to NASA, VHF1 is used for emergency audio-only communications with the ISS while VHF2 is used to communicate with Soyuz when out of range of Russian VHF ground stations to ensure communications during every orbit for both ISS and Soyuz spacecraft.

The upgrades, NASA said, improve electronic components and involve installing new software for tracking the station and Soyuz. Moreover, the agency said new antennas will be installed at ground stations to allow for simultaneous operations in both VHF1 and VHF2, which adds redundancy should one system fail.

“Maintaining the availability of utility-like communications between the crew and the ground is paramount to enabling mission success and ensuring crew safety,” said Mark Severance, human spaceflight communications and tracking network director, in a NASA news release. “The NASA VHF network, in combination with the VHF network operated by our Russian partners, does just that.”

NASA has two VHF ground stations—one at Wallops Island in Virginia, and another at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in California—to maximize coverage of the orbiting complex while over North America, the agency said. They are managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. Russia’s VHF ground station are located across its country to allow for communications while the ISS and Soyuz is over Asia and Europe.

The space station itself has two VHF1 antennas to send and receive signals. These are located on the Russian Zvezda service module at the aft-end of the outpost. Each Soyuz spacecraft, meanwhile, has a single VHF2 antenna on the aft-end of its service module.

“The purpose of [the ground station] upgrades is to ensure the VHF ground stations remain a robust capability for backup and emergency communications,” Severance said. “The addition of redundancy, the ‘belt and suspenders’ approach, is particularly important given that these systems would only be employed due to failure of the primary space station communications system or an emergency onboard the Soyuz.”

While the VHF system allows for audio-only radio communications, however, the Space Network allows for much-higher data transmissions on the order of several hundred megabits per second. NASA said this allows for a variety of data-consuming activities ranging from real-time high-definition video, data transmission for hundreds of science experiments and live TV interviews with astronauts and cosmonauts.

The Space Network, which uses the TDRS spacecraft, is also managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

"Among other things, the atlas will allow scientists to study the traces of smaller galaxies that were swallowed up by the Milky Way. “Looking at these remnants, we can look in detail about how we think galaxies are forming,” said Dr. Timo Prusti, a Gaia project scientist. “How did the Milky Way come into existence, and what is the future of it? With the Gaia data, it’s possible to address these questions.”

As Gaia orbits the sun, the spacecraft slowly spins to allow its two telescopes to scan the sky and study some 100,000 stars each minute. The 3-D atlas, based on data collected by Gaia over a 22-month period, shows the sizes of the stars as well as how they are moving and how far away they are from us.

“Knowing how far [a star] is tells us how bright it really is, not just how bright it appears to us from Earth,” Dr. Evgenya Shkolnik, an Arizona State University astrophysicist who is not involved in the Gaia mission, told MACH in an email. “And once we know how bright it really is, well then, all sorts of other amazing astrophysics questions are unlocked.”

In addition to all those stars, the map shows the positions of more than 14,000 asteroids and 500,000 quasars, which are ultra-bright celestial objects fueled by supermassive black holes.

"Gaia’s sky in colour

Gaia creates richest star map of our Galaxy – and beyond

ESA’s Gaia mission has produced the richest star catalogue to date, including high-precision measurements of nearly 1.7 billion stars and revealing previously unseen details of our home Galaxy. A multitude of discoveries are on the horizon after this much awaited release, which is based on 22 months of charting the sky. The new data includes positions, distance indicators and motions of more than one billion stars, along with high-precision measurements of asteroids within our Solar System and stars beyond our own Milky Way Galaxy. Preliminary analysis of this phenomenal data reveals fine details about the make-up of the Milky Way’s stellar population and about how stars move, essential information for investigating the formation and evolution of our home Galaxy. “The observations collected by Gaia are redefining the foundations of astronomy,” says Günther Hasinger, ESA Director of Science.

The Galactic census takes shape “Gaia is an ambitious mission that relies on a huge human collaboration to make sense of a large volume of highly complex data. It demonstrates the need for long-term projects to guarantee progress in space science and technology and to implement even more daring scientific missions of the coming decades.” Gaia was launched in December 2013 and started science operations the following year. The first data release, based on just over one year of observations, was published in 2016; it contained distances and motions of two million stars. The new data release, which covers the period between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016, pins down the positions of nearly 1.7 billion stars, and with a much greater precision. For some of the brightest stars in the survey, the level of precision equates to Earth-bound observers being able to spot a Euro coin lying on the surface of the Moon. With these accurate measurements it is possible to separate the parallax of stars – an apparent shift on the sky caused by Earth’s yearly orbit around the Sun – from their true movements through the Galaxy. The new catalogue lists the parallax and velocity across the sky, or proper motion, for more than 1.3 billion stars. From the most accurate parallax measurements, about ten per cent of the total, astronomers can directly estimate distances to individual stars. “The second Gaia data release represents a huge leap forward with respect to ESA’s Hipparcos satellite, Gaia’s predecessor and the first space mission for astrometry, which surveyed some 118 000 stars almost thirty years ago,” says Anthony Brown of Leiden University, The Netherlands. Anthony is the chair of the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium Executive, overseeing the large collaboration of about 450 scientists and software engineers entrusted with the task of creating the Gaia catalogue from the satellite data.

Loading... Gaia’s first and second data releases Access the video “The sheer number of stars alone, with their positions and motions, would make Gaia’s new catalogue already quite astonishing,” adds Anthony. “But there is more: this unique scientific catalogue includes many other data types, with information about the properties of the stars and other celestial objects, making this release truly exceptional.”

Something for everyone Loading... Asteroid survey Access the video The comprehensive dataset provides a wide range of topics for the astronomy community. As well as positions, the data include brightness information of all surveyed stars and colour measurements of nearly all, plus information on how the brightness and colour of half a million variable stars change over time. It also contains the velocities along the line of sight of a subset of seven million stars, the surface temperatures of about a hundred million and the effect of interstellar dust on 87 million. Gaia also observes objects in our Solar System: the second data release comprises the positions of more than 14 000 known asteroids, which allows precise determination of their orbits. A much larger asteroid sample will be compiled in Gaia’s future releases. Further afield, Gaia closed in on the positions of half a million distant quasars, bright galaxies powered by the activity of the supermassive black holes at their cores. These sources are used to define a reference frame for the celestial coordinates of all objects in the Gaia catalogue, something that is routinely done in radio waves but now for the first time is also available at optical wavelengths.

Cosmic scales covered by Gaia Major discoveries are expected to come once scientists start exploring Gaia’s new release. An initial examination performed by the data consortium to validate the quality of the catalogue has already unveiled some promising surprises – including new insights on the evolution of stars. Galactic archaeology “The new Gaia data are so powerful that exciting results are just jumping at us,” says Antonella Vallenari from the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF) and the Astronomical Observatory of Padua, Italy, deputy chair of the data processing consortium executive board. “For example, we have built the most detailed Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of stars ever made on the full sky and we can already spot some interesting trends. It feels like we are inaugurating a new era of Galactic archaeology.”

Hertzsprung-Russell diagram Named after the two astronomers who devised it in the early twentieth century, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram compares the intrinsic brightness of stars with their colour and is a fundamental tool to study populations of stars and their evolution. A new version of this diagram, based on four million stars within five thousand light-years from the Sun selected from the Gaia catalogue, reveals many fine details for the first time. This includes the signature of different types of white dwarfs – the dead remnants of stars like our Sun – such that a differentiation can be made between those with hydrogen-rich cores and those dominated by helium. Combined with Gaia measurements of star velocities, the diagram enables astronomers to distinguish between various populations of stars of different ages that are located in different regions of the Milky Way, such as the disc and the halo, and that formed in different ways. Further scrutiny suggests that the fast-moving stars thought to belong to the halo encompass two stellar populations that originated via two different formation scenarios, calling for more detailed investigations. “Gaia will greatly advance our understanding of the Universe on all cosmic scales,” says Timo Prusti, Gaia project scientist at ESA. “Even in the neighbourhood of the Sun, which is the region we thought we understood best, Gaia is revealing new and exciting features.”

Galaxy in 3D Rotation of the Large Magellanic Cloud For a subset of stars within a few thousand light-years of the Sun, Gaia has measured the velocity in all three dimensions, revealing patterns in the motions of stars that are orbiting the Galaxy at similar speeds. Future studies will confirm whether these patterns are linked to perturbations produced by the Galactic bar, a denser concentration of stars with an elongated shape at the centre of the Galaxy, by the spiral arm architecture of the Milky Way, or by the interaction with smaller galaxies that merged with it billions of years ago. At Gaia’s precision, it is also possible to see the motions of stars within some globular clusters – ancient systems of stars bound together by gravity and found in the halo of the Milky Way – and within our neighbouring galaxies, the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds.

Loading... Globular cluster and dwarf galaxy orbits Access the video Gaia data were used to derive the orbits of 75 globular clusters and 12 dwarf galaxies that revolve around the Milky Way, providing all-important information to study the past evolution of our Galaxy and its environment, the gravitational forces that are at play, and the distribution of the elusive dark matter that permeates galaxies. “Gaia is astronomy at its finest,” says Fred Jansen, Gaia mission manager at ESA. “Scientists will be busy with this data for many years, and we are ready to be surprised by the avalanche of discoveries that will unlock the secrets of our Galaxy.”

A series of scientific papers describing the data contained in the release and their validation process will appear in a special issue of Astronomy & Astrophysics. A series of 360-degree videos and other Virtual Reality visualisation resources are available at http://sci.esa.int/gaia-vr Gaia is an ESA mission to survey more than one billion stars in our Galaxy and its local neighbourhood in order to build the most precise 3D map of the Milky Way and answer questions about its structure, origin and evolution. A large pan-European team of expert scientists and software developers, the Data Processing and Analysis Consortium, located in and funded by many ESA member states, is responsible for the processing and validation of Gaia’s data, with the final objective of producing the Gaia Catalogue. Scientific exploitation of the data will only take place once they are openly released to the community. More data releases will be issued in future years, with the final Gaia catalogue to be published in the 2020s. This will be the definitive stellar catalogue for the foreseeable future, playing a central role in a wide range of fields in astronomy. Gaia was originally planned for a five-year mission, operating until mid-2019. ESA has already approved an indicative extension until the end of 2020, which is up for confirmation at the end of this year.

The incredible Gaia space telescope blasted off from Earth in December 2013 on a mission to observe and study the deep expanse of space above us. Just three years after launch, Gais released its first set of observations and calculations on the distances and movements between two million stars. However since then, ESA astronomers have upped the ante almost a thousandfold, to share their observations of 1.7 billion stars. And the ESA has teased “the best is yet to come”.

"The Milky Way just became a little less mysterious.

This week, astronomers from the European Space Agency (ESA) released a 3D map of the galaxy. It utilized data from the agency’s $1 billion Gaia mission, which launched in 2013 on a mission to map the stars.

The spacecraft’s newest dataset contains information on about 1.3 billion stars—650 times more celestial bodies than the ESA previously had access to.

Situated on the side of Earth opposite the sun, Gaia has mapped about one percent of the Milky Way so far in an attempt to figure out its history.

Gaia’s telescope can accurately observe stars up to 30,000 light years away. That’s the equivalent of a person on Earth spotting a penny on the moon.

The new dataset also includes information on stars’ colors, which can offer crucial details about surface temperature and age.

It’s not just stars, however—Gaia also observed over 14,000 asteroids orbiting around the solar system.

And now that scientists have the data, the analysis can begin.

According to Scientific American, astrophysicists in the Flatiron District of New York started poring over the data on Wednesday in search of new discoveries.

These researchers were especially interested in the proper motion of stars, or the speed with which they move across the sky.

They’re also focused on Gaia’s motion and position because this data can help map both the Milky Way’s future and its past.

This practice is known as galactic archaeology. Scientists are winding back the clock on the galaxy to trace its 13-billion-year history and figure out how stars are born.

Fittingly, they’re starting with the stars closest to Earth. Researchers can now pinpoint the three-dimensional motion of about seven million stars within a few thousand light years of Earth.

Scientists are also hoping to discover new exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system that orbit stars, with Gaia data. NASA’s Kepler space telescope has already mapped thousands of these structures, so scientists can use the new information to both confirm Kepler’s findings and potentially unearth new planets.

That hasn’t happened yet, but the Flatiron physicists have already discovered a system of brown dwarfs. These celestial objects aren’t planets or stars, but sized somewhere in between—they also emit infrared radiation. Scientists aren’t sure yet how they form, but Gaia’s data could help with that discovery.

Their end goal exists far outside the Milky Way, however. They also want to use Gaia as a roadmap to find more than 500,000 quasars, or supermassive black holes surrounded by gas and dust. Quasars only exist in distant galaxies, but getting information from them can help scientists figure out how the Milky Way was formed.

Gaia’s next data release is planned for 2020, with one more coming sometime in the next decade. Space nerds surely await both of them with baited breath.",tech,http://observer.com/2018/04/milky-way-3d-map-could-reveal-new-planets-massive-black-holes/

NASA’s Hubble captured first image of surviving companion to supernova

Washington: NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured the first image of a surviving companion to a supernova, a compelling evidence that some supernovas originate in double-star systems, the US space agency said. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured the first image of a surviving companion to a supernova, a compelling evidence that some supernovas originate in double-star systems, the US space agency said.





Seventeen years ago, astronomers had witnessed a supernova go off 40 million light-years away in the galaxy called NGC 7424, located in the southern constellation Grus, the Crane, the NASA statement said. The image of the companion star was seen in the fading afterglow of that supernova, called SN 2001ig.





SN 2001ig is categorised as a Type IIb stripped-envelope supernova. This type of supernova is unusual because most, but not all, of the hydrogen is gone prior to the explosion.





According to the study, published in the Astrophysical Journal, the supernova's companion star was not just an innocent bystander to the explosion. Instead, it was most likely the instigator, as it siphoned off almost all of the hydrogen from the doomed star's stellar envelope, the region that transports energy from the star's core to its atmosphere.





Millions of years before the primary star went supernova, the companion's thievery created an instability in the primary star, causing it to episodically blow off a cocoon and shells of hydrogen gas before the catastrophe.





Originally, these type of exploding star were thought to come from single stars with very fast winds that pushed off the outer envelopes.





However, when astronomers started looking for the primary stars from which supernovas were spawned, they could not find them for many stripped-envelope supernovas.""That was especially bizarre, because astronomers expected that they would be the most massive and the brightest progenitor stars,"" said Ori Fox, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, US.





""Also, the sheer number of stripped-envelope supernovas is greater than predicted."" This fact led astronomers to hypothesise that Type IIb stripped-envelope supernovae may instead be a result of co-orbiting pairs of binary stars.





""We know that the majority of massive stars are in binary pairs,"" said lead author Stuart Ryder, an astronomer at the Australian Astronomical Observatory (AAO) in Sydney.

""Many of these binary pairs will interact and transfer gas from one star to the other when their orbits bring them close together,"" he noted.

Since the early 1960s, scientists have known about the so-called “dead zone” in the Gulf of Oman, a patch of water practically devoid of all oxygen. As anyone who has ever owned an aquarium knows, even fish require oxygen, but as a surprising new survey shows, the Arabian Sea features an oxygen-starved aquarium the size of Florida—and it’s still growing.



Dead zones, or oxygen minimum zones as they’re more formally known, are natural ocean features located at depths between 650 to 2,600 feet (200 and 800 meters). Significantly sized OMZs are known in about three or four key places in the world, and they’re caused by sensitive imbalances between the available oxygen supply in the atmosphere and the decay of organic matter.

Scientists have only had a hazy conception of the dead zone located in the Gulf of Oman, a strip of ocean sandwiched between India, Iran and Oman, and an important gateway into the Persian Gulf. New research published today in Geophysical Research Letters has uncovered a “dramatic increase” in the size of the Gulf of Oman’s OMZ, an observation that heralds bad news for the region’s aquatic life—and possibly our atmosphere in general.

Scientific surveys of the OMZ in the Gulf of Oman were conducted in the 1960s, and then again in the 1990s. These efforts mapped the OMZ and found that it was practically anoxic (meaning no oxygen) in the center offshore region between Oman and India, and featuring low oxygen levels, or suboxic waters, around the peripheries. Owing to piracy and ongoing geopolitical tensions, scientists haven’t analyzed the OMZ since then, which is problematic given all the climactic changes our planet has experienced over the past several decades.

Now that things have (somewhat) settled in the region, and owing to advances in robotic technologies, a research team led by Bastien Queste from the University of East Anglia’s School of Environmental Sciences, with help of Oman’s Sultan Qaboos University, has completed an updated survey of the OMZ—and the results were not good.

“As part of this project, we went to the Gulf of Oman, which shares its water masses with the wider Arabian Sea, and found that the oxygen was much lower than we thought from the outdated data,” Queste told Gizmodo. “The region is now anoxic—essentially extending the Arabian Sea OMZ into the marginal regions, much closer to where people live, fish, and depend on the marine environment. Hence the growing concerns.”



Using underwater robotic subs called Seagliders, and computer models to simulate how the water is mixed around, the researchers say the whole Gulf of Oman is now either in a suboxic or anoxic state. That’s an area around 63,700 square miles in size, which is about the size of Florida. But the researchers suspect it’s even larger, and that it’s still growing.

“There are a number of things that could have contributed to the shift—the most major of which is very much tied to climate change,” said Queste. “The oxygen levels are determined by the balance of oxygen supply from the atmosphere, mixed in by waves, eddies, and just general energetic mixing near the surface, and oxygen loss, primarily the oxygen being ‘breathed’ by bacteria living on and eating sinking decomposing organic matter.”

Queste says the increased warming via climate change means bacteria are able to breathe more, but it also means the surface layer is warmer, which creates a stronger barrier between the warm surface water and the deeper cold water (a density barrier) which reduces the amount of oxygen being injected into the ocean.

“Climate change will also change wind patterns which will change surface energetic mixing,” he said. “Increase in land use, larger cities, and increased pollution will also lead to more nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, entering the water, which promotes more algae that later sink and get consumed by the bacteria,” adding that “It’s an incredibly intricate system with many moving parts!”

The next step for Queste’s team is to conduct a deeper dive, so to speak, to better determine the causes of the growing OMZ. The water mixing explains part of the picture, mostly from season to season, but it doesn’t sufficiently explain the big shift from 50 years ago. Queste says it would also be valuable to know if the overall supply of oxygen is decreasing, or if it’s the consumption of oxygen that’s increasing.

“Another interesting question is now that the Gulf of Oman is clearly consuming oxygen faster than it is replenished, how much of that is exported to the Arabian Sea and making the wider Arabian Sea OMZ extend and grow even more?,” he asked.
